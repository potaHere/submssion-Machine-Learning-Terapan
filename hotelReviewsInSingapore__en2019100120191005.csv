0,"The area is where the most famous sightseeing of Singapore is allocated. You can sit on the rooftop of the hotel having drinks or visiting the restaurant, spoil yourself with the luxury shopping in the mall, or sit on the bay. At 20:00 there is Fontaine show. Skyscrapers at night look so elegant. Really nice place to visit","July 13, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

2,"The hotel itself is fairly standard, nothing particularly outstanding besides the rooftop infinity pool. From the outset, there were mixed feelings about the whole experience, the bell boys on arrival are so rushed and over worked that we had to drag our bags to to check in after 16 hours of flying and arriving into 35 degree soaring heat, the check in experience itself is hectic and feels like you are at an airport and results in reaching the counter and the usual form filling (I don't know why in this day and age we still do this, why can this not be done in advance - especially at a 'top hotel'). Once the room was allocated things did improve, the room was pleasant but again without being anything special it had everything you'd expect but nothing wowed.As mentioned in the title, the real highlight of this hotel was the infinity pool, amazing views over Singapore with a long pool across the whole 57th floor, also at the back of this floor, there are a few jacuzzi's which overlook the Gardens by the Bay which is great at night. In summary, if you want a 5 star experience stay elsewhere, if you want to pay for the rooftop pool picture stay at MBS.","July 11, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

4,"We stayed at both Marina Bay Sands and Fullerton Hotel on the same trip, and wish we had stayed at the Fullerton the entire time instead. The MBS is nice if you like the Vegas type of experience. One night would've been enough for me, just to check it off the bucket list. Like many other reviews said, the infinity pool was a zoo with everyone and their selfie sticks. If you're looking for a true ""luxury"" experience with charm and quality service, I'd recommend staying at the Fullerton Hotel.A side note on the coffee, MBS had those instant coffee packs (see photo) and a hot pot. I don't need anything fancy like a Nespresso machine (which the Fullerton has), but having real coffee in the room would've been nice.","July 10, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

9,Visited the hotel. Went to bar for a drink and for the view. Staff at the ground entry were rude and couldn’t give a toss. Stood waiting for acknowledgement but the young lass was to busy texting. Unfortunately a common occurrence now in Singapore. Drinks ok but again service poor. As mentioned previously it appears now the current generation of young workers are more interested in their status than their jobs. I have been to Singapore many times so noticed a significant difference to previous visits. ,"July 8, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

10,"I have stayed in MBS two times now and it is incredible. The first time I stayed in a room on the 39th floor facing stunning city views. The rooms are exceptionally clean and I was very impressed by the folded towels that would resemble different animals such as Elephants, Swans and Crabs. It was very creative and I appreciated the excellent room service. The views from the infinity pool are breath taking and I would encourage anyone who is planning to visit Singapore to experience viewing the city skyline from the top of this beautiful hotel. The pool is very clean and there is plenty of space to take pictures without it being overcrowded. On our second visit we stayed in a room facing Gardens by the Bay, and it did not disappoint! Again, their was nothing to fault with our room and we had a balcony this time which was amazing for watching the to the huge ships sail past during the day and the Gardens by the bay light show at night. Some people might be put off by the price but I feel that it is worth every penny. Excellent service, clean Rooms, comfortable beds, outstanding views from the infinity pool, amazing food and drink...it ticks all the boxes! Also forget to mention that there is a huge selection at breakfast! You can choose anything from bacon and eggs to chick curry and dumplings. I hope to return to Marina Bay Sands Hotel soon.","July 8, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

Even the House Keeping staff assisted by providing additional toiletries which was greatly appreciated. The staff (Concierge Desk, Check In, House Keeping and the Supervisor Guest Services) were all outstanding in their care and assistance.A beautiful place to stay.

18,"This is absolutely the best choice for everyone in Singapore. You can do so much inside this property. You have the mall, which is the biggest and the nicest in Singapore. Plus, the gardens are just behind the hotel, the infamous infinity pool and the science museum which is filled with so many nice exhibitions and galleries. In addition, the theater is also adjacent to the hotel which is usually home to a lot of great shows. This is the second stay for me in MBS and this time, I got a family room which was just PERFECT.

The restaurant there is excellent! If you go at ngiht, there is a light show in the bay that was spectacular. Since the weather is hot, the things to see are at night.

Staff is super friendly and perfectly organized. All seems like a clockwork, the cuisine is wonderful. I definitely recommend breakfast here. If you want a view, choose Spago, if you want great variety go to Rise.Rooms are spacious, clean of course and decently decorated. They even make a new towel animal everyday for you!

30,"MBS is a huge complex, above and below the surface, an architectural icon that could easily fail as a hotel by becoming impersonal, but quite the opposite is the case. The establishment is immaculately maintained and run by great people. We were checked in early after arriving at the hotel at a loose end at 6.30 in the morning. Got a great sleep in on the comfy bed and was up by mid-afternoon to explore the city. The food on the spectactular rooftop is amazing - we dined at both restaurants. The one closest the pool (forget the name now) was the best. The manageress gave us individual attention, and took time out to give us tips on where to get the best street food in Singapore - not something you might expect at a 5 star hotel. She was lovely, friendly and genuine, and sent us free drinks after chatting to us. Impressive stuff for a hotel with so many rooms and an endless queue of guests. Needless to say, the views over Singapore and the bay are something to behold. The gym was good too.","July 2, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

31,"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was everything we thought it would be. I booked for one night in a superior L40+ city view which ended up to be exactly what I paid for. The room was very large, clean and had a cracking view overlooking the city. Staff are very friendly and one indvidual had gone the extra mile to give us early check-in and early access to the pool. The infinity pool was the highlight for me especially considering the good weather we had. There are countless things to do within the hotel and within the shopping centre. The only downside would be that as I only booked for one night it's hard to cram all the things in that Marina Bay Sands has to offer.  A very enjoyable stay!","July 2, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

34,"As a flagship hotel of Singapore, located at the golden location, marina bay. This hotel is a must for us.However, I think the hotel was too crowded, too busy, too business-wise for us. As a family of 4 travelling just for fun, it didn’t feel right. The lobby feels like a train station or airport. Lucky us we booked the club room so we had a fast-track check in. The shopping mall is good offering many restaurants and shops. The infinity pool, observation deck, roof top bar were too busy at all time. We went there early morning (7 am) hoping to see no one in the pool but no, there were hundreds of them already everywhere. The evening canapé at club 55 is one of the best I’ve ever had. They offer bigger-than-normal-canapé portion compared to other hotels with wide selection of excellent quality food. While checking out, we phoned front desk and asked for a bellboy to help carrying our luggages down, but were informed that we have to wait for 20 mins so we decided to carry things down to the lobby ourselves. In general, I think it’s worth going once, but don’t expect 5 stars service as it seems impossibly when the hotel is that big. You need a sophisticated service protocol to handle the amount of guesses you have.","June 30, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

Although there were quite a few other people enjoying the facilities as well, the pool did live up to the hype. As for the hotel itself, albeit MBS is not considered the best hotel in Singapore by locals, we thoroughly enjoyed our spacious, comfortable and clean room from which we could see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay. To be honest though, the main reasons to stay here are the pool, the view and the wow-factor, not the rooms. In any case, the staff was very accomodating.

40,"I have to be honest: this is not a luxury property though price per night might make you think it is. So, I you expect the best service and a good value for your money, go to the Four Seasons or the St Regis. This is a very expensive hotel and it's not exclusive at all. Maybe social media seduced you (yeah, that's how I fell for it) and you wanna try it, which is ok, but take this into consideration before booking and spending your money. That being said, I don't regret at all the night I spent here. It's very easy to get here from the airport: metro takes you to the entrance in no time. Though it's always full of people everywhere, check in and check out went really fast for me. The lady who helped me check in was amazing: she said a room with view was available and though that wasn't the room I payed for, she wanted me to really enjoy my experience in the hotel. And I did! Views to Gardens by the Bay were amazing. I think my biggest disappointment was the infinity pool, which was precisely why I wanted to stay at the hotel hahaha I almost had a heart attack: there were SO many people in the pool!! It opens at 6 am and some girl was saying that she woke up at 5:30 am just to take pictures and it was already full. You can hardly get a chair and waiters are slow (and food is expensive), but ok, trying to be positive, views are great from the pool and once accepting the fact that you're in beautiful Singapore and enjoying the best views of the city, it's ok. So, in summary, it was a good experience for one night but that's it.","June 28, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

43,"We booked the Marina Bay Sands for the last 2 days we were in Singapore and I must say how impressed we were with this hotel, having been to Singapore 8 months earlier and checked out what was there, shops,food court & restaurants we decided to hang the expense and stay there this time. Check in was a 3pm but we arrived around 12 and they found us a room on the 25th floor as we had requested a room on the gardens buy the bay side, there are more expensive rooms on higher floor but this room was in our budget this time.All the staff are so professional with dealing with the guests and nothing is a problem, we were staying in tower 3 and what I liked was the security guard at the lift entrance checking room keys (stops non guests accessing the accommodation floors)Our room had a spectacular view over the Gardens which has the impressive light show, with so many restaurants to choose from the food court to restaurant's like Gordon Ramsay & Wolfgang Puck you should never go hungry, the views from the infinity pool on the top level are the best in Singapore the pool is guests only so you carnt take friends in unless they have a room key as well, the drinks and food around the pool is waiter service which you can pay cash or charge back to your room.Do yourself a favour and stay at Marina Bay Sands even if only for 1 night you won't be disappointed,we will certainly be staying there next time we are back in Singapore ","June 27, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

45,"Arrived to the hotel early, at around 9:00, but was lucky to receive the keys anyways. However, we had to pay 100 SingaporeAn dollars for an extra bed, which was a hit overpriced. Got a room at floor 41. The room was nice; big and pretty clean. However, you have to be careful about accidentally using it taking something that costs money. When ordering food, be aware that things like ketchup costs extra money. (2 Singaporean dollars for 1 small cup!!) Learnt that from experience. ","June 26, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

Rude people, ignorant people, some courteous people, and a few smiles from staff.The rooms are OK. The bed is hard! Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. The internet in the room and hotel is woeful!! Constantly drops out.The top deck pool is unique and easy to get a lounge. Just beware the photographer in the pool......they want from S$140 up......The food in the restaurants is quite good, coffee is excessively expensive and drinks are even worse.

49,"Stayed here with family in June, and had a nice stay. The hotel is large, consisting of three towers with over 40 floors in each, so the number of guests is very high. Most of the facilities have been designed for these numbers, so things worked mostly OK.This is a nice luxury hotel, but most of the (very high) price of stay is for the infinity polls on the roof of the hotel, and the views to Singapore and views/access to the Marina Bay gardens. For those things one could pay that money (once), but for other (or longer) stays there are better luxury options in Singapore, and for (far?) less money. Rooms higher up are more expensive, and rooms lower are less expensive.Rooms are nice and modern, with the kind of decoration and facilities you would expect from a 5-star hotel (see some comments on this later though...)Breakfast can be had in any of 3 restaurants. We got in right away, but it seemed that this restaurant had prepared for having people queue to get to breakfast (signs or indicating waiting times like 12 minutes.) The breakfast options were quite good, what one would expect.Access to the pools and the bar/observation deck is controlled by swipe cards. We went swimming in the pools, and also took some selfies and other photos (as did most of the crowd in the pools: very few were there for swimming/relaxing.)The hotel is connected to the neighboring upscale shopping mall, with lots of luxury stores, as well as restaurants and a food court. The food court is with normal Singapore pricing, but it was very full and the problem was finding a vacant table. The other restaurants there are a bit more expensive, but not too much so.The Marina Bay gardens are right next to the hotel, with a 5+ minute walk to the central areas with the artificial trees. They looked nice also in the evening from the room window. The views also otherwise are interesting: sea, cargo ships, possibly cruise ship or two, and some of the suburbs to the east.Some things to whine about:Getting to the hotel with MRT on the (not yet complete) circle line requires a train change at Promenade, as (most, all?) trains on that line continue to Dhoby Ghaut. A small nuisance (which may disappear when the circle line will be completed in the future.) Also the downtown line has a station at the hotel/mall, thus giving more direct access.We could not adjust the room temperature, except by turning off the air-conditioning completely (and keeping the balcony door ajar). With aircon on the temperature did not get higher than 21.5 C no matter what the setting was, 24 C or 27 C. There was a sign on the wall telling that temperature change will take time. But several hours was not enough. (And in other hotels temperature would change in 1 or 2 hours at the latest.) 20 C is too cold, and we prefer a bit more than 22 C.In a luxury hotel one would expect a bidet or a fancy toilet seat with washing features. Did not exist here, which is unusual for a high-end hotel. The hotel should fix this for all rooms.","June 24, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

50,"Our Group of 7 paid a visit to the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The view is undoubtedly spectacular! Although each ticket holder was given $20 to spend at the bar, after purchasing 3 cocktails, 1 whiskey and 3 bowls of fries. We were still out of pocket $70! You can view the pool from the bar and be tantalised by the fact you can’t enter. We did not pay extra for the viewing platform and am not unhappy we didn’t! I’m not sure the view is that much better?! Definitely worth a visit!! Grab a drink and soak up the scenery, you’ll feel like you’re on top of the world!","June 24, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

Its got great view and big space, view is amazing however, they restrict your entry for infinity pool for not more than what amount of access cards you hold.

The hotel is located a bit outside the actual ""hotspot"" in Singapore (but all the shopping destinations etc. are still within walking distance), but the hotel itself is full of all kinds of experiences, the world-famous infinity pool being the highlight for us. The rooms were flawless in all regards.The staff really goes the extra mile to make sure that you as a customer are happy. We even got a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room and a nice chocolate cake served in our room since we had an anniversary.This isn't the most budget-friendly accomodation in Singapore, but as a once-in-a-lifetime experience it was really great. We were staying for just one night when travelling from Batam (Indonesia) to Johor Bahru (Malaysia) through Singapore.","June 24, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

53,"It was my 4th time staying at MBS and I always enjoyed it. I always request high floor 11th floor up facing the gardens. This time my family got room 3116. When you are going to the infinity pool make sure to catch sunrise and sunset (wait for the buildings to open their lights up). The pool gets crowded at peak hours like 5-8pm so i advise to go early. Free towels are provided and you can bring it back to your rooms.There’s a free observation deck visit on your stay so make sure to use them. There’s a pamphlet that they will give during the check in explore everything on it for free. There are lots of restaurants to choose from within the hotel and nearby.There’s an Express check out and it saves your time! A deposit fee of S$200 is required upon check in on top if your room fees. Check in is smooth with little nuisances because a trainee staff assisted by a senior processed my check in. What I don’t like. The quality of the water in the pool. It’s just me, Because imagine lots of people are in and out of it. The lavatory in the rooms is shallow that when you open the faucet the water will be all over the place because of the strong flow.All in all its a wonderful tourist experience. Having your beer while watching the sunset from the infinity pool and enjoying the views of the skyline.","June 23, 2019","0    Marina Bay Sands

54,"We arrived here at dawn hours after a major flight delay. The door was closed but after making some noise someone came out to open the door for us. The staff recognized us as the last customer to check in for that day and immediately check us in for us to rest. The beds were small but doable I guess. The room was good size with a nice size bathroom. We got two usb charging ports by the bed, but the charge for an iPhone was super slow. So a plug in outlet for the charge would be better. Anyways, the rooftop pool was neat. They have a supply of towels and free water bottles to drink. Also, there was a small whirlpool but it was under maintenance when we went. The housekeeping was on top of things, they were there at 9am in the morning to start cleaning. Though I wish they would stock more towels, still they clean our rooms daily. The checkout process was smooth and released our $200 deposit right away. The location was perfect. We basically walk to the places we wanted to visit. Bus and MTR stations nearby. 7-11 and a food court downstairs. We will definitely stay here again if we visit Singapore again.","July 12, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

63,"This is a pretty no-nonsense hotel. It is as everyone notes in a great spot, so for that alone I'd recommend going there - it's kind of halfway between the Orchard Rd shopping stuff and the marina/ Clarke Quay areas.The room is very neat, minimalist and functional. We had everything we needed, including a kettle and tea but not much more. Bathroom is pretty small so best to take turns. We got the balcony room - there's no view really and it's too hot to spend much time out there but would do it again as it adds a little sense of space to the room. The pool on the roof is small but quite lovely, a good view and not many chairs but we found we usually got one. The 7-11 next door does make up for the lack of a bar up there, just get yourself some drinks and chips and off you go... Breakfast totally fine for us but not a full big hotel spread. There is, most importantly perhaps, a Din Tai Fung around the corner. Mmmm, dumplings.So it is not an exciting hotel but there's also nothing upsetting about it and it's not badly priced. Only complaint at all isn't really their fault as most Asian hotels do it - but putting the full price of your room on hold, then charging you again for the final bill - the pending charges take a week to 10 days to clear, which affects your balance on a debit card (or a credit card you may have run rather close to the limit...) But otherwise, a perfectly nice place to stay and we'll probably be back.","July 2, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

64,"What can I say. This hotel has everything. Check in process was smooth and we were escorted to our room on the 10th floor, a king deluxe room. The room was small although we expected this given it was a city hotel. However, the room was well arranged to allow us to hide our suitcases and make the most of the limited space. Room was tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. Room was cleaned regularly while we were having breakfast (which by the way was excellent, extensive and tasty). It was really nice to come back upstairs after breakfast to a cleaned room which was only left vacant for around 30mins for breakfast. Room service was very very speedy when asking for things like extra towels and an iron. The hotel is excellently located, under 2 minutes walk to Bencoolen and Bras Basah stations, and a 5 min walk to Dhoby Ghat Station. This means that with the excellent transport links Singapore offer, you rarely will need to interchange to go anywhere. It is also close to some bus stops. 5-7min from Orchard Road and Plaza Singapura. Hotel also had an excellent rooftop pool and Jacuzzi which we wish we had made more use of. No complaints whatsoever with this hotel, highly recommended and would always book again.

Raffles and Cjimes are literally just around the corner. MRT only steps away. So easy to get around this wonderful clean city. Our room was spacious and had 2 bathrooms which was great. We also utilized the guest laundry facilities which is situated on the same floor as the Gym. $8 SGD per wash and the same if you wish to dry your load (we dried ours in our room).The pool is clean, but refreshing! Sadly, we only used it once as we were busy exploring.Our son also loved the skatepark at Somerset. A great free activity (he had his skateboard from home) and we spent several (hot) hours there. It took us around 20 mins to walk there from the hotel.Orchard rd is also a short stroll away.Breakfast was sufficient and the cappuccino machine was great. Breakfast staff were friendly and helpful.

It was a thoughtfully put together room, with spacious and convenient storage areas so that I could stash away luggage and clothing unobtrusively keeping the room uncluttered. The room also included a mini-fridge, kettle with coffee/tea and safe all easily accessible, but ""hidden"" so you can move unhindered around the room. A really good use of space.The bathroom facilites are flawless; all the amenities are modern and top notch.Wifi was speedy and without problems, and there are numerous, conveniently placed power outlets, and even USB chargers available. Copious desk space as well to lay out laptop, shopping etc.The breakfast selection is decent, with good variety. Always a plus as it allows you to get a head start on your daily activities.The location is itself fantastic, a really great base for exploring the city either on foot, or further afield via the MRT. It's about a minute from the MRT Station on the Downtown line which connects to Bayfront, Downtown, Chinatown and other stops of interest. Also about 5-10 minutes away from the Dhoby Ghout MRT station on the NE line. Within easy walking distance is the National Museum, Fort Canning,(the Battlebox Museum tour is quite interesting) and even Clark Quay via an overpass from Fort Canning.

Reception staff were excellent in every encounter - this is the only reason I'm not giving this place a ""poor"" rating. Rooms are tight as always in Singapore - but asked about a luggage rack and there isn't one. So put your case on the floor and you suddenly restrict your ability to move around. Room amenities were all as expected for the price. Shower was one of those that washed the bathroom floor as well ..After 28 days of travel, this was the second worst breakfast we encountered (the other in Namibia - so really no comparison). No egg station & eggs in the warmer were luke warm & rubbery. Bacon was also only tepid. Cereal selection a huge fail - no muesli or anything not filled with sugar. Asked for decaf coffee where elsewhere was given a sachet & hot water - ""not available"" was the response here.Location is great & I was using this stopover to gauge if this was the right place for my husband & I next year. A good breakfast is a must for us and tepid meat is a disaster waiting to happen so the answer is no.","June 17, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

From allowing early access to our rooms after an overnight flight, to going out of their way to personalise service throughout our stay, management of this hotel should be very proud of their team. Great pool area we used every day with our little water baby, nice serviceable and clean rooms and a fantastic location close to the MRT. We were in walking distance of several amazing hawkers centres as well as big ticket tourist locations like Gardens By the Bay, Orchard Road etc. Definitely recommend this hotel for its affordability and quality. Special thankyou to Honey for going above and beyond. Traveling with a 3 year old isn't always easy but the hotel certainly helped ease the way.

76,"Was a little dubious of this hotel from the reviews, however we thought it was nice. Yes the room isn’t the most spacious but more than ample room for 2 larges suitcases. Bed was comfortable and shower was good. Pool area only had a handful of beds but was always quiet when we were up there. The downside is the breakfast. It was ‘adequate’, barely. There may be a variety of choice, but nothing that would be a good choice. Ended up with toast and jam. Would still recommend, just don’t count on breakfast.","June 7, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

77,"First of all, the front desk and lobby staff were perfect, always friendly and helpful and personable, on every shift, night or day. (perhaps even better than the 5 star Marriott Tang hotel).This complement about the staff includes the cafe/bar staff, and the housekeeping staff for the room. They made you feel very happy about staying there.The hotel appears very new, and is hi-tech (for example, they have an app that tells them when you turn on the ""make-up room"" sign). The rooftop pool is excellent, and with great views due to the acrylic paneling that lets you see through the top floor railing. The price value was excellent, especially for Singapore, and the hotel was perfectly located for easy food, taxi, MRT, bus, tourism.The room and bathroom design were very well done, and very comfortable, making it all feel bigger that it was. The bedding was great and we slept well. The showerhead and water temperature/pressure were excellent. Really liked having a mini-fridge in the room, instead of a mini-bar.","June 5, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

We used the gym and although small adequate to maintain a training regime. The rooftop pool is just perfect and after a day in the Singapore humidity, a god send. We also had breakfast included and the range and tasty foods were great. Singapore has such an efficient and easy train network, from the airport you need only jump on the downtown (blue) line and the Bencoolen station is opposite the hotel. On our checkout day they stored our bags and provided access to the pool and changing areas late into the afternoon so we could freshen up before heading to airport.... we will definitely recommend and stay there again.

80,"I spent five nights there with my father on a family trip. We had a spacious double bed room with enough space. The room was clean and the AC not too loud so it was usable at night.The location is really great as two metro stations are just around the corner. Within 15-20min you can make it to China Town, Marina Bay or even Bayfront. Fort Canning and some historical buildings can be reached by feed. If you don’t want to book the hotel breakfast (which offers a wide choice of Western and Asian food), restaurants with a good breakfast are just next to it.The pool on the roof is great when the temperature is climbing over 32 degrees Celsius. The staff was always friendly and helpful. We left our luggage in the hotel after check out as we had a very late flight. When picking up the luggage we even could take a shower at the pool to refresh after the heat of the day.To sum it up: Great stay and would be our choice again.","May 26, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

We had a room with a balcony but probably a bit of a waste as when it rains there is no cover so you cannot sit outside but was still nice to open door for fresh air. The only thing I would say was not good is there is only one draw to put clothes in as the other one has the safe in it so we just kept clothes in our case. We did try to order poached eggs for breakfast but they didn't understand us, other than that this is a great hotel in a perfect location with train and bus stops very close, great restaurants around it also.","May 15, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

Rooms and public areas always clean but you barely notice the staff. All staff we did encounter were great. Breakfast selection is decent and will set you up for a day of exploring SIN. $30 dollars to the hotel from airport journey time is around 25-30 mins. MRT would also be fine if you were on a budget and was only a few dollars each for a single trip. Rooftop pool is excellent and great for an afternoon dip to cool down. Gym and Laundry on level 5 were also great facilities to have. $8 for washer and $8 for drying. Saved travelling home and having to do it all.","May 8, 2019","1    30 Bencoolen

86,"Stayed two days berore or cruise ship left for a tour of Asia. Centerally located in Singapore for about $150 U.S. per night while most hotels in this area charged two to three times as much. It is rated 4.5 stars by those who stay there and it is an excellent, modern, and very clean hotel. They have very high standards for cleanliness and it is a high crime to litter in any public area. In addition, it is illegal to buy or sell gum in Singapore so not black spots on the sidewalks or pavement. It is also near several local hawker centers (think food court). Went out about 5 AM to get coffee and found most restaurants and coffee shops closed but an adjacent 7-11 covenience store was open 24/7. Even at this early hour, I felt very safe on the streets. You will probably save a lot, if you use this hotel.Everyone we saw dressed very well and probably better than most Americans.

Pool area is ok with too few sun beds. Jacuzzi next to pool worked only once and was a bit dirty. We did not find separate pool towels anywhere so bring your own from the room. Pool is otherwise ok. Very tiny gym. Minimally equipped. Restaurant (same where breakfast is served) service average compared to what you can find close by. Therefore restaurant almost always totally empty during evening. Reception service very good. Location excellent due to being next to Bras Basah and Bencoolen MRT stations. Both within 100m walk. Good wifi at least in 8th floor.

Despite all 4 hotels on our trip having the same booking conditions, 3 of them immediately refunded our money due to the exceptional nature of the cancellation. This hotel however, demanded to see personal medical documents to prove our case and then completely disregarded them. We felt humiliated having to provide such private information to a hotel which didn't need them and their subsequent attitude was completely dismissive. We even asked, not unreasonably, if they could issue a credit to enable us to rebook at a later date, but they still said no.

Room is smallish but sufficient. I prefer to think of it as space conscious and minimalist. Being able to borrow the mobile ph was awesome and a surprise. I've booked for my layover on the way home too...I don't need to pay $600 a nite to be satisfied. Thank you!","June 1, 2019","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

116,We chose this hotel for an overnight stop in Singapore and were not disappointed. We did not need to be in the city so Katong was not too far from the airport but with a good neighborhood of restaurants and shops. The room was clean and new - well set up and the bed nice and comfortable. Staff were friendly and efficient. Great choice for stopover.,"May 22, 2019","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

117,"We were in transit through Singapore Changi airport and through our own poor planning, forgot to book accommodation for the overnight transit. The Changi airport lounges were all full booked but luckily, the airport staff directed us to Holiday Inn Express in Katong, which was a 10-15 minute cab ride from the airport. The staff were extremely helpful on the phone, considering it was 1am in the morning and we told them we would be arriving in 20 minutes at their hotel.They checked us in, without fuss and very friendly front desk staff. Our room was small but had everything we needed to freshen up and have a good nights sleep before our travels the next morning. Breakfast was included the next morning, and the food was standard breakfast buffet. The restaurant was VERY busy as it looked like there was a school trip happening at the same time. However the staff managed the chaos very well, and were very quick to accommodate our requests when we needed something.","May 16, 2019","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

119,"Holiday Inn Express Katong (HIEK) isn't cheap. But it is functional and will meet your basic needs.HIEK is for those travellers who want assurances of a clean room, with availability of the usual hotel services like Wifi, a cafe, laundry services etc.Upon arrival,you will need to take the elevator/lift to the reception/check-in desk. Do not expect porter services. There is none. Expect to queue up before you are served at check-in area. The room is small. There is hardly any space for you to store your luggage. This is not your standard deluxe room in hotels where you can lounge in the room. But, there is in room wifi and a TV, a,common self-service laundry room located on the same floor as the cafe. I paid for a package which included breakfast. The cafe is crowded in the morning peak hours but I found the food served not worth queuing up for. HIEK plus point is its proximity to eating choices i.e. local casual food or Katong 112 Mall which offers air conditioned shopping, eating and banking services. Parkway Parade nearby is much bigger and has a good food court in the basement. There is also much more shopping options here.Stay at this hotel if you want to be in the Eastern part of SGP and you have budget constraints. Otherwise, there are other Holiday Inns to choose from downtown or other options to choose from.","May 2, 2019","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

Check in was okay even at 1:30 am but the rooms are tiny! The reception is on Floor 7 which I find extremely odd but what’s even worse - is the breakfast. We went at 9:30 am as recommended but what chaos! I have never seen anything like this at any hotel anywhere in the world!!! It was like a feeding frenzy! Nowhere to sit and there was even a cordoned off area for a group. If we were not so hungry, we would have skipped it.

However, this hotel exceeded all my expectations during my 1 night staycation. Firstly, hotel is very new . Although basic, the front desk is welcoming enough. Staff are friendly . As I’m an IHG member I was given a high floor with a decent enough view. Room is nice, basic and simple, you get all you need without the luxurious stuff. Breakfast is included, again simple fare but good enough for me. Hotel is conveniently located to some nice restaurants nearby. All in , a very Happy stay.

130,"Perfectly clean room when checked-in. Room size is ok for a short stay and small family. the breakfast was super compared to the price you are paying in Singapore. Amenities provided were great, especially hand wash and Shower gel, which were in liquid dispensers beside the shower...so basically was unlimited and refilled by housekeeping. The best part was the Juice and Ice cream vending machines in the lobby, very useful in the night time. Katong area is a great area to live, lots of eateries around the hotel, 7/11 and bus stop very close by. I dont know why most people complain about the distance to MRT, its just 2 stops away by Bus 10, 12 or 14. The best part was the pick and go breakfast packs, we would pack some light fruits and muffins after breakfast and eat them as snacks before lunch. Also, one great thing is their water bottle supply, the executives at the reception will happily provide you one or two bottles when leaving the hotel for a city tour. Will I return...ofcourse.

132,"Location – situated in the east side of Singapore and not near by MRT stations, this property attracts tourists who are looking for something different to do in Singapore. A couple of peranakan / heritage stuff to check out nearby as well as cafes and limited shopping stuff. Also a good choice for short layovers and you need a place to rest but don’t want to be too far from the airport.Price – Your Rate Advanced Purchase @ $112++ ($130) which is only applicable if you are an IHG Rewards Club member. For the targeted promotion of 1 night to Gold, 3,000 bonus points (I have no idea why they called it “birthday bonus”), plus 1,000 additional points for making the booking in-app, it was fair value for what I paid.Check In – Painlessly completed at the main hotel lobby (7th foor) at 3pm but thereafter a queue formed behind me so get here early if you can.Room – my non-smoking Queen Deluxe 1338 was fair space at 19SqM and actually it didn’t feel too tight for 1pax due to the clever design. Bathroom was adequately fitted out and had a dispenser for the 3-in-1 shampoo / body soap liquid. No issues with cleanliness. My TV was not working due to some connection issues – but within 30mins a technician came up to my room and fixed it. They even have an Adriod (they call it handy?) to bring out if you wish to – nice!Breakfast – The Great Room on level 7 was seriously packed at 9:30am on a Sunday. Food was a let-down being bland and uninspiring. Also feels very chaotic and the cleaning crew were absolutely drowning. I know its a HIE and I shouldnt be expecting much but I remembered better breakfast at HIE in Bangkok.Facilities – I didn’t manage to chek out the 24hr gym which was also on level 7. Beside the main reception was a small-ish pantry with snacks and drinks available for purchase. Also a fresh orange juicer for $2 a cup.Service – Polite and efficient although I can see that the staff sometimes struggled with an influx of guests checking in / out.Check Out – I dropped my key card into the Express Checkout and went off.

Breakfast area is large and spacious however it is quite crowded all the time and noisy even i sat outdoor area (outdoor area is way better than indoor if you would like to have a more quite breakfast time). I would like to point out the housekeeping standard is so different every time during my whole stay in the hotel. The towels in bathroom are fully equipped only on my arrival day. Day after, hand towel missed 1. Second day after, face towel all missed. Last day, floor mat was gone and suddenly 4 dental kit were placed and the housekeeper took away the toothpaste that my friend and I were using. And I got to open a new dental kit just for the toothpaste. This is quite weird and I doubt is there anyone check the room status first before the guest is back to the room?

152,"Stayed for 4 nights in this hotel as a couple. It was a 10 minutes ride from Changi airport ( we arrived early in the morning) and as the name says it is an express hotel and the services was provided accordingly..Our check inn was smooth though we arrived early around 8 in the morning..all the staff spoke good level of English ( this was expected of Singapore) and helped us in every way they could..The breakfast spread was good and it has all the things that should be there in a hotel chain. The hotel itself is above the Singapore's oldest shopping mall which has also a food court in it..the nearby areas are full with little food joints and restaurants which are not so hard on your pocket.The only minus would be the location.. Not near metro and the nearest bus station is a 10 minutes walk. There is a taxi (i think its GRAB) kiosk in the hotel itself which can be used to get to the nearest metro or anywhere else..It does not have a swimming pool, the beds were comfortable and all the necessary in-room amenities was there..Overall it was a nice experience with the hotel keeping the price in mind as Singapore itself is pretty expensive.. Will love to visit again!!","November 20, 2018","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

TV channels have both local and international such as HBO, CNN...However, you would need to pay for parking. Breakfast is decent with mixture of American and Asian varieties. There is a nice ramen at Ground floor. And a nice ice cream shop across the road.","November 19, 2018","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

155,"Available for an excellent price in a city like Singapore with a breakfast included: quite unlike most hotels that we found within that budget. The hotel has a minimalistic appeal to it with all essentials: a trolley to help you carry heavy baggage, swift check-in and checkout, a clean and warm room which is very well kept. Further, the hotel has focused on keeping themselves environmentally conscious and minimally reduce human effort: for example - soap dispenser is fixed with liquid soap to avoid regular refilling. So is the case with the shower and body gel: they are two in one. You would witness many such points including the placement of light switches in the room, the reading light, so on and so forth.Lastly, the breakfast is quite lavish, so do manage to catch it between 6.30-10.30 am! And yes, many good restaurants and malls are walking distance from this hotel. So, the location will always be a true winner! Don't forget to check out ""Zaffron Restaurant: A Michelin Star"" one at a stone throw's distance :)","November 8, 2018","2    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Katong

As an Express Hotel, rooms are not big, we were staying a week, we managed missed a lounge or Balcony, but accept for the rate it served its purpose. Location is great no MRT but it is coming, but regular bus service into the central city, and tourist locations. Breakfast was adequate very clean area, and staff friendly.

157,Hotel is very clean and near to alot of eateries and bar for chill out. A shopping mall is just 2mins walk away and city centre is 10-15mins away by taxi. The only minus point is there is no porter or hotel staff to assist you when you arrive at the driveway of the hotel. Security guard present is rude and not helpful and flexible.

The rooms are a little small once two travellers have their baggage open and their isn’t very much privacy for the bathroom, but is perfect for what it is - an express hotel.

204,"Park Avenue is a great place to stay if you are in Singapore and you want a quieter ambience to escape the stress of the city. From the moment of checked in until I have checked out I knew i will have one of the most pleasant memories here. I have the young manager Samantha to thank for that. She was very genuine, smart, kind and very pretty too. She assisted me with landmarks to look out for while navigating through google maps as she was very familiar with the locations I will be visiting. It was truly helpful for me to have the confidence that i am on the right track. No matter how busy she was with her work she never fails to either smile at me or greet me whenever im in the lobby. There is no doubt that she is a good leader and her colleagues could learn a great deal from her. On a side note, the rooms are spacious and cozy and great housekeeping too.","May 9, 2019","3    Park Avenue Rochester Hotel

224,"Thinking of a short holiday break, just recently returned from Singapore which having had stop overs a couple of time we decided to make it a little longer especially after seeing the movie ""Crazy Rich Asians"" . We flew with Singapore Airlines which are one of the better carriers and upon arrival we decided to check out the latest creation Jewel which is next to the airport. You can't take your bag trolley in so get them stored. It's a walk to the dome but quite impressive inside. But in reality it's really a large shopping mall with a very impressive water feature & gardens. We stayed ate the Holiday Inn Atrium in Singapore which is very impressive with 27 floors with internal lifts that go up the wall & you can view out. The room was very good not small at all like most of the others I've organised but this time we booked the room at the same time as our flights thru Flight Centre who are always helpful. The hotel staff were very friendly & helpful organizing shuttle bus or taxis as required. The Holiday Inn offers a free shuttle bus to Orchard Road which has many shops to choose from. To get around especially for returning to hotel we used the Taxis which are very cheap, clean & readily available, given time I might have figured out the subway or buses. We also booked the hop on hop off buses which was the best way around to get to the main sights. We did the Gardens by the Bay, which is a massive area and takes in many other sites, the Merlion of course, Chinatown & Little India all in one day. The night bus for a tour is one you must do as seeing the Garden by the Bay show is very impressive. There are 2 shows with the second & less busy one at 8.45pm. Little India was a disappointment not very clean unlike Chinatown which had the best souvenir stalls. Food & drink is expensive as everything is imported. Singapore doesn't have a fishing industry or farms so expect to pay more & if you eat in a restaurant you may also have to pay 10% service Charge & 7% GST which pushes the price up. All in all the people are friendly the shopping is fun but watch out for the humidity can be a real drainer on your energy. Also a must do is breakfast with the Orangutans at the zoo. I would give Singapore 7 out of 10 as a destination.","May 22, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium

230,"We used this hotel as our Singapore stopover base. Location wise it’s an easy walk to china town and Clarke quay.Holiday inn is one of our preferred brand for a quick stay, usually.The first corner (level 22?) room we were given was small and old - although that wasn’t the problem. The room was musty and smelt damp, the wallpaper was peeling and there were mould patches on the wall and ceiling. Inconsistent with our expectations of the IHG brand and rather unhealthy Bring very tired we tried to ignore it - however after leaving the room for awhile and coming back in - there was no doubt this room had an unhealthy mould/damp issue and in our view should never have been given to anyone.Once bringing it to the attention of the front desk they promptly moved us - although it’s frustrating they felt it okay to put someone in there. This problem is identified in other reviews it seems.Breakfast was excellent and overall the service was quite good.

238,"This hotel is old style but it is reasonably well maintained. The down side is the noise with an atrium design. Some inconsiderate people yell at night and it echoed the entire hotel corridor. Luckily, it only happened twice at night during our stay. Otherwise, no other issue with noise. The room is well equipped, except the chair needs to be replaced urgently. The synthetic leather is peeling off. Room is spacious for 2 adults and 1 child. The staff was very helpful and communication via email wasn't an issue. We had breakfast included and tried both lunch and dinner buffets. A lot of varieties and all were excellent. Hotel guests get 50% off for lunch and dinner. The price is steep without the discount but i assume this might be standard in all SG hotels.The main down side is the location. I don't find it convenient like others have commented. There are only a few buses go right in front of the hotel. The closest outram park MRT station is 17 mins walk. We were traveling with a toddler and pushing the stroller in the hot and humid weather was not ideal. We tried to catch a bus that went to outram park MRT station, which was also 10 mins walk and required carrying the stroller up and down a pedestrian bridge. Thus, our main mode of transportation was taxi. Another issue is food selection. It would have been convenient if it is near a shopping mall which one can just go out and eat there to save some money. Adjacent hotel restaurants are equally expensive. For the location, I think the room rate isn't value for money. I had stayed at somewhere in SG before with the same price tag but it was much more convenient for food and traveling around. There will be a new MRT station next to this hotel in 2021. I might give it a miss until then. Unless the price is really attractive in the future.Another thing that's worth mentioned. The hotel only provided us the complimentary ""handy"" phone on our last day. I wish it was provided earlier on. it could have been very helpful with the bus route and entrance tickets. The ticket offers were actually a lot better than what i got online so i felt a bit bummed. Overall. A good experience so a 4 stars rating.","March 12, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium

There is a lot in the area for eating - not too much shopping. One night we ate in the Xin restaurant and that was very good. Even my Chinese Singapore friends said it was authentic. My challenges came from a surly staff, ridiculously expensive buffets of marginal quality, and the overall ‘feel’ of the hotel. There are massage parlors next door and women with dubious backgrounds and professions could be seen arriving at late night hours. It is an interesting place and very, well, earthy at times.

242,"This Holiday Inn in Singapore boasts: fine bedrooms and suites, including smoking rooms, a varied and exceptional buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner comprising a special children's corner offering their favourite cereals, nutella and marshmallows. The Holiday Inn has a broad and inclusive employment policy; We have befriended in particular a young boy who takes charge of directing traffic and ordering taxis in the hotel forecourt. When our boy blows his whistle - you stop and listen - you move your car - you get out of the way. Our boy Owns the forecourt of the Holiday Inn. His work ethic is second to none, and he is greatly loved and indispensable to all the staff. When we arrive at the hotel, he drops his whistle to give me a hug.Down in the basement of the hotel you will find two shops that sell Everything: needles and thread, aka seltzer, sticking plasters, fresh sandwiches,T shirts, coffee, and any kind of alcohol your western heart might desire. The owner will often toss in a free banana with your purchases. On the day of my departure, the beautiful wife of the owner took me by the hand and led me around the shop to choose a packet of biscuits for my 10,000 Km journey home.A hotel is a community, a village that cares about its inhabitants. This is one such delightful village...","February 13, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium

243,Hotel====The hotel was nice and clean but the location is a bit of annoyance as there is no metro station nearby so we had to travel by Grab (online taxi service like Uber) all the time. Breakfast=======Excellent buffet breakfast that caters to everyone's choice. Staff====Helping and smiling staff. River Walk========The hotel is near to river and I highly recommend everyone to take the river walk that goes all the way to Merlion park. Tip:===I bought a local Starhub sim for 13 SGD and it gave me 100 gb data for a week. The sim worked in Malaysia and Bangkok as well. ,"February 11, 2019","4    Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium

257,This is a very old property and looked completely un-prepared for the holiday season. We stayed here for 5 days during Christmas period and surprisingly the hotel operated just 2 out of their 6 reception counters. This shows how unprepared the property was for peak holiday season; long lines at check in and check out. Rooms have also not been upgraded for so many years. I was surprised to see the bar in this hotel offering just had 3 options for a single malt whiskey; even small roadside restaurants in Singapore offer more options than this.

Genuine service la. Love that she replies to a bride to be any time of the day u Whatsapp her, sometimes i find myself irritating but she is still abiding and good. Down point is, she was not there on my wedding day but she made a great handover but i felt her presence might be better cx she knew everything from start.My check in was great, we were given our rooms and enough linens in rooms and amenities even for my folks room and bridesmaids. Everybody was hepi. Rooms were clean and great. Esp bridal room for me was more than i expected. Their lunch set for the wedding couple is sandwish but i felt is gud enough because of its portion and accompaniment. Food for room service and breakfast is bravo. Rooms is a stayable and returnable experience... i recommend anyone to go there to stay...My wedding is a special one because i was met with a bad incident, my hubby could not be present so groom was not around and my wedding reception is to go on but there were so many that cud be done better. 1. Firstly, the bellboy whom sent my my pictures for my photography album table was gone, my box of pictures was sent to a room and sitting there and no info was told to my bride squad.2. The hotel promised dry ice effect but it was little and hosts were seen near our entrance and midst of the walk, lettinng the dry ice thru.3. Door from the kitchen was always opened and seen by guests4. When i was marching in with my dad from the entrance, there were so many of the team around but no one help to settle my train which was so long but clumped together for the entrance march in.5. I have requested for steamer before arrival to be ready in bridesroom was not there. So lots of time wasted. 6. There were so many empty seats but crew was pushing my squadteam to open another table as it is running out, feeling the pressure they opened another table when i felt there is no need for that.Overall experience is fine but not fab for a sad wedding.What i love is their set up was exactly and more than i wanted for the banquet tables, they gave me a third vip table as i specially want it for my sister... everything they did was fab but attention to smaller details would be terrific...Best thing on Holiday Atrium Singapore would be me winning their grand draw and a $5k off my wedding banquet... never won anything in my life but u all sure can try have ur weddings there.Still gotta say, this plce is worth the try for a holiday, service was great for rooms... fnb daily breakfast is awesooooome!!!Thank you","November 14, 2018","4    Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium

There is a definate variance in the rooms - from uber budget (smaller, no windows) to more spacious with heaps of light. I would recommend requesting a room on the third floor if you like quiet, however, if your like me (and can sleep through anything) the ground floor is super convenient.The location is phenomenal - honestly, it's so central. Awesome food everywhere, great shopping within walking distance, super easy to get transport (MRT / Taxi etc). If your looking for a more local feel, Little India can't be beaten.One thing I must mention the Sandpiper is the staff. Theyre all great, but Gill and Deneesh are absolutely fantastic. Deneesh was always super happy, genuinely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. He is a credit to this establishment. Gill - what can I say?

This also meant good transport links across town from Mrt. Enjoyed the stay and slept well, water was provided on second day but not first - bathroom is a wet room. It was clean and tidy and we used it as a base for seeing Singapore. Tekka centre is about 5 min walk and is a local hawker centre for breakfast and lunch!

Of course, its front desk officer, Mr. Gil is very helpful to hotel guests, and even finds time to accommodate queries and exchange of information. On the other hand, Ms. Jasmin's way of communicating to hotel guests needs improvement. Her tone of speaking is not widely acceptable in the hospitality industry where Sandpiper is part of.

Staff were sloppy at times but other things made up for it. Firstly, the lifts were extremely fast getting you to where ever you wanted in seconds. The gym was small but had everything you need. The pool was only about fifteen metres but had sections for all ages. There was a small pool next to the large one that I wasn’t sure what was for. It was extremely cold sand shallow. The water was warm in the big pool and had a water fountain on the side. There were many places to sit around the oil with a whole second story with pool chairs. Your room came with a smallish bathroom with a clothes line, toilet, shower/bath and sink. It provided you with free toiletries, robes, slippers and water not forgetting the very convenient spare room key. The television channels were delivered in a a small amount. It had a grand view from your bedroom window and had a wide range of lights throughout your room. The mattresses felt like lying on the floor though as they were very hard. I was impressed that they gave you a free phone to take travelling with you throughout the city. It said you could make free class but the hotel guide said something about cost per call. The hotel is located in a very convenient spot making it easy to access malls and has a large spot for taxis. The hotel also has a shuttle bus service but I personally didn’t get to try it.

Nothing dries in the rooms. Bathtowels and swimming stuff is still wet after a day and night of drying.We were here for a sailing regatta so come home with a lot if wet clothes. There was a dehumidifier in our hallway which had not been in use for at least 24hrs. The water reservoir was full and no one emptied it. I brought it to our room, emptied it and seitched it back on: 88% humidity. After 1 hour we already had it on 80%.When we were in bed by 21.20, 2 men showed up ringing our doorbell and waking up my son to ask if we had the dehumidifier in our room. Every right to ask but maybe not at that time...Bathroom also had a sewage smell after it had not been used a few hours.","July 3, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

333,"Stayed here twice over the past 2 months. The first time was in celebration of my daughter's 3-year-old birthday. I had requested for a small card with the words Happy Birthday just to wish her. The Front Office Team (special mention to Ditta) went above and beyond that to make a gorgeous hand-made card for her and also prepare a cake. Together with the Housekeeping team, they decorated the room so beautifully, making her day extra special and memorable!When we came back the second time, my daughter had remembered the little towel bunnies that were prepared the first time, so I made a request in the booking if she could have them again. When we entered the room, there were no bunnies and she was a little disappointed. It was evening time when I called the hotel reception to ask if I could request for them. The Housekeeping department called me soon after to apologise that they could not fulfill that request that day because the person who made them was not around. However, they set a time for the room to be made up the next morning, and for some towel bunnies to pop in. We brought my daughter out the next morning, and when we came back, not only was there a family of bunnies, but a family of elephants and a towel monkey too! And of course, my daughter (and her parents) was ecstatic.The hotel was clean and safe, with excellent service all round. This is certainly a place we would come back to again in the future!","July 3, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

334,"I have stayed here many times. This is my third review in 14 years. During this time most of the rooms have not be renewed, you can see wall paper lifting and water marks on the walls. The carpets need refreshing.They claim that you get a 10 % discount if you are a Le Club member. I am and it would not take when I tried to book on line. 4 weeks later, I am still trying to get a response from Accor. Their arrogance is palpable. The location of the hotel is good for me as I want to me on the East Coast. But there are newer hotels nearby that I will now try as the attitude of the hotel is too poor.","July 2, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

The concierge gave excellent advice and the room travel device was very useful when calling a taxi to return home. This was our second stay and is our preferred hotel in Singapore. Breakfast was excellent and the pool bar food was fantastic including the service. I would absolutely recommend this as a place to stay - there is a shopping centre opposite.,"June 30, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

337,"I stayed twice within a week at this hotel. Mostly it is ok. It is close to the airport and reasonably priced. There is a shopping centre across the road that has most things. But there is no access to the MRT. They do have a shuttle bus every hour to the airport. However, the first stay was in a Club Room. The room was good and the lounge has a nice view. Sadly the evening canapés were mostly Tofu. If you like that, great. I don't. And a tip, eat breakfast in the restaurant it is much better than the lounge.On the second stay, the noise from the bathroom exhaust fan kept me awake and was most annoying. They do turn it off centrally at 11PM. So my sleep quality was poor.","June 23, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

339,"We held our wedding lunch banquet at the East Coast Ballroom last Sunday, with the assistant of Mike, Gabriel & Haslinda. They've helped run the event so smoothly, all of our guests only have positive remarks about the food and service. As we had some guests who did not turn up last minute, Mike and Gabriel had advice us to split the food to other tables so that we can minimize wastage, which was really commendable.We would totally recommend other couples who are intending to get married, to consider holding their banquet at the hotel. Firstly I think it is really value for money given the overall experience we had, the total costs incurred and the services rendered to us. Secondly, we had a really comfortable stay in the bridal suite as well. The room size can accommodate the couple, makeup artists, photographer and even some of the wedding entourage. We didn't feel overwhelmed at all. We were also surprised with a bottle of sparkling juice, some fruits and snacks upon our check in, which we felt extremely touched. Lastly, we would like to send our warmest regards to the banquet team for making sure everything went according to our plan. We didn't have to worry much about the banquet, everything was coordinated well between our groomsmen & the banquet team. Thank you all once again! :)","June 19, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

344,We were flying in from Greece very early in the morning and decided to use the Grand Mercure Roxy as a transit hotel as our flight home to Australia wasn’t until one and a half days later. It is not located in Changi airport it is around 12 k away so you do have to clear immigration and customs but that was a breeze for us at 430am.We arrived by taxi at 445 am - the hotel does have a free shuttle to and from Changi Airport but it doesn’t operate between the hours of around 1030 to 7 am . We were greeted at the door and our luggage stowed in a trolley by the porter while we checked in. We had booked a room for the night previously to ensure early check in .Check in was quick and efficient . The porter accompanied us to our room with our bags .The room was spacious and clean . The bathroom was a good size with shower over bath . There was a good range of toiletries supplied .We slept until around noon then spent the afternoon by the gorgeous pool . We ate 3 meals at the Breezes Bistro served by the very professional and friendly Eddy. The food was delicious and the coffee and wine great .We obtained a late checkout so spent the following morning at the pool before getting ready to go to the airport to catch our flight home to Australia . The shuttle service delivered us to the airport in a timely and efficient manner .I really liked our stay at this hotel . The staff were very professional and helpful . I have booked to stay again in November when I next pass through . Thankyou to the staff we enjoyed our short stay and were sad to leave.,"June 11, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

This is a place to celebrate the Asian Culture, most specially the mix of Chinese and Malay race, and savor Perinakan cuisine.

346,"Looking for somewhere close to Changi Airport for an overnight stay or somewhere a bit cheaper outside the city centre of Singapore, then the Grand Mercure Roxy in historic Katong could be the place for you. It is about 15 minutes from the Aiport and the hotel provides a free hourly shuttle to and from the airport.The rooms are spacious and modern with a good sized bathroom and comfortable bedroom. Ours had a small fridge, safe and coffee/tea making facilities and two comfortable, mini-double beds (may be good for marital bonding.) The hotel has a nice swimming pool, fitness centre and a number of restaurants and bistros. We recommend the Japanese crockpot, a salmon dish, in the Breez Bistro and Bar, but go easy with the accompanying small dish of chilli sauce, although there are lots of local restaurants close by. The hotel provides a free one way shuttle to Marina Bay, the Esplanade and ION Orchard on Saturday and Sunday and a hourly one way shuttle to the MRT train station between 8.30 and 11.00 a.m. on weekdays.Hard to fault, reasonable price (although nothing is cheap in Singapore) so recommended.","June 8, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

349,"that many hotels claim to be 4* but, when I compare them to the GM Roxy, they always fall short. Large comfortable rooms, a willing friendly staff that still provides a service to the traveller, air conditioning that really works, a great location halfway between the airport and the city and a desire amongst everyone to ensure that you have a great time all adds up to a really good hotel. OK, It’s not the Ritz, but of the several hotels I’ve stayed at in Singapore, it’s the only one that I’ll willingly come back too - and some supposedly score more highly in Trip Advisor, but I’ve been there, seen them and when I compare them to the GM Roxy I get the feeling some reviewers really have very little experience of what makes a good hotel. This hotel remains one of my all time favourites, it is a home away from home when I’m travelling and I cannot praise it enough. Please don’t change, in a world where everything is cheapening and dumbing down, the simple comfort of the GM Roxy is a stable point in my itinerary.","June 4, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

350,"All our stays at the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy have been nothing but pleasant, the most recent one in early May was just excellent from check in to departure. Some staff members went over and beyond to provide first class service which I feel is worthy of mention:George, our room attendant, not only did a wonderful job with the cleaning, he went through a lot of trouble to arrange our toiletries immaculately, tidied up the desk and coiled all our mobile phone cables with the wire ties and placed them very neatly. That to me shows that he takes great pride in his work which reflects a good image for Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy. We were so impressed, my husband called Housekeeping to thank him. Shortly after, there was a knock on the door and we were met by Regina Chin, Executive Housekeeper together with George with a ""Get Well Soon"" card wishing my husband a Speedy Recovery on his eye surgery which was very thoughtful and much appreciated. Many of the other staff like the Concierge were also very caring and concerned which meant a lot to us. We enjoyed a sumptuous dinner at the Feast@East Buffet Restaurant on Level 3 during our previous stays and have never been disappointed, in fact, it just keeps getting better with a great selection of Peranakan food as well as Western. Many of our friends and family members who dined at this restaurant have also enjoyed it immensely. There’s also the Breez Bistro Restaurant on Level 4 with equally good food.The rooms are a good size, very comfortable and clean, toiletries and beverages replenished daily as well as fresh clean towels. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Room with complimentary fruits which was a pleasant surprise.The location of the hotel is superb for more than one reason, firstly it is 15 minutes from Changi Airport with easy access to the city centre by public transport. There is a shopping mall directly across the street and many other shopping malls in the East Coast that you can get to by public transport. There are many restaurants & bars in Katong, most within walking distance so you will be spoilt for choice with lots of great food.Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy also provide guests with complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport as well as to the Paya Lebar MRT Station where you can ride the train to many different locations in Singapore. The friendly concierge and Reception staff would be more than happy to help you with directions. We had the pleasure of meeting Jennifer Narcis, Director of Sales & Marketing on our last trip and was happy to give her our feedback. For many years, we stayed at hotels in Orchard Road but that is now in the past as there's so much more happening in the East Coast which we don’t seem to have enough time to cover on every trip.","May 31, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

351,Through past years this hotel has become our favourite in Singapore. Usually [except when prices skyrocket due to some f1 or suchlike venue in town] price-quality of experience ratio is pretty good here. Good sleep quality and fairly comfortable rooms.I would even say that common areas have greatly improved compared to a few years ago. We enjoy the location that is less busy than more central parts of Singapore. Proximity to the sea allows for an odd breeze to come through and it feels less damp here compared to central Singapore. Pool area is a pleasant and relaxing spot that we enjoy during our stays.Airport shuttle included in room price makes it easy to access the hotel as long as you are not fussy and your flight is not at some ungodly hour.,"May 28, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

Reception kindly gave me a map of local sights; its easy to walk to the beach (watch out for the brief heavy rain showers though - caught me out!) and to the beautiful old Peranakan buildings.

The first time I took the opportunity to upgrade (at my cost) but it was not worth it (no real benefit for the upgrade), so opted not to for the second stay. Rooms are a little tired now and possibly need some work. Neighbours can be very noisy in the middle of the night, not the hotel's fault but shows the lack of sound proofing in the hotel. Breez Bistro Bar has a happy hour but I am suspicious that the glass size does change for this, and the price was higher than advertised, and no attempt to refund to look after the customer, just complained that management had not changed the advertised price when they were asked to.

Overall Great Location, The F&B Establishments Food and options are Superb, Staff Level are Great. I've stayed several times over the past 3 years. Had only 2 bad experiences. The first one is for another review. This review is more about the Management of the Hotel. They cannot account why I lost items in my room.They actually made me feel and covertly implied that I was not being truthful on my claim that the items that were lost in my room.They were note even able to write a report about it because in their opinion nothing happened. They left the weight on me as the guest to PROVIDE that the items were indeed lost while it was in my room. I wrote to ACCOR on the experience but it got routed back to the same management team and they their concessions as compensation but my feedback here is when you wish to claim that concession they say it was only valid during the month of the email or they just conveniently cant find a document that they even committed different.I have status, a regular guest staying almost monthly for at least a week at a time.Imagine how other guests that stayed and lost something then definitely those are incidents that just get thrown out as flukes but to be treated like this as a member with status and a frequent guest really is BAD. Management doesn't put premium on Member Status or Regular guests. JIt is quite a shame. I feel very happy staying at the hotel and most of the staff i already know by name and they also know I am a regular guest. It's the management of this property that has an issue how to take care of guests.To ensure that I dont loose sleep that something might get lost in my room again. I will wait until the management gets their act together before I consider. I'll stay other properties that I have status for now when in Singapore.","May 2, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

362,"I stayed at 3 hotels during my Singapore visit and while this hotel wasn’t bad, it my least favourite of the three. This is mostly due to the location. The area is under construction at the moment (certainly not the hotel’s fault) and while there is a bus stop nearby, there are no MRT stations within short walking distance. I also find that taxis had a hard time finding the place — overall, the location is inconvenient if you’re trying to do a lot of exploring/sightseeing. The room was spotless, although the decor is a bit old/dated compared to other Singapore hotels that I stayed in. The hotel has lots of decent snack and food options although they’re on the pricey side. The pool looked very nice, although I didn’t use it. The free airport shuttle is a good convenience. The front desk/concierge staff were great — friendly, helpful and accommodating. No issues with check in or check out and they answered all of our questions quickly. My only issue was with the housekeeping staff — because of the 12-hour time difference, I was fighting jet lag and would start my days rather late — around 3pm. Despite the do not disturb sign on my door, housekeeping would come by and ring the bell/knock on my door every 30-40 minutes, asking when I was leaving the room so they could clean. I understand that they have a job to do and definitely appreciate their eagerness to keep my room clean BUT, it was very frustrating to be awaken multiple times on each day of my stay to fight with housekeeping when I specifically put the do no disturb sign on my door. I did not appreciate feeling like I was being rushed out of my room each day. This isn’t a bad hotel for a one or two-night stay. The staff are great, the hotel is decent. But it certainly wouldn’t be my top choice for a longer stay in Singapore.","April 27, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

363,"This hotel is located away from the bustling city, yet it is near some of the most charming place singapore can offer. The parking is a little confusing, as it share the same carpark with the shopping center, but easily accessible to the hotel though. the lobby is huge, but the room is just normal singapore sized hotel, which we can't complain. The check in staff is helpful, courteous and was fast. all done in 5 mins.It is walking distance to the big shopping mall opposite the hotel, just cross the road by traffic light and you can find ALL sorts of food around.BUT the hidden gem is walking to the back of the hotel, look up KATONG ROAD on google map, and you will see lots of local delights and pubs and western, try katong laksa and nasi lemak, then the juicy steak, and look for the famous bak kut teh (pork rib soup) and there's awfully chocolate, and also local delicacy, plus a new ice cream place that seemed to be always long queue. All thes food will not break the bank, as they are located at not too pricey place, they offer good price.Walking further towards the sea, you get to enjoy the seaside (try not to swim, a little poluted but if you are adventurous...) rent a bicycle, or if a family of 4, rent a quadcycle and have some family fun, great seafood place at night but expensive, but I promise you the CRAB is HUGE if you ordered the right stuff. Must try singapore chilli crab with bread. And lastly, satay and beer to down the taste.","April 26, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

365,"We had a great second stay at this hotel having stayed once previously in 2018. We booked an ocean facing room on a high floor. On checking in we were assigned a room on the 14th floor which was perfect. The rooms here are great. The Wi-Fi is also great. We requested a second bed for our young son and it arrived within 5 minutes of getting into our room. The same goes for our bags which were bought up almost immediately.The free airport shuttle is awesome. We followed the instructions provided and found the transport desk at the airport where we booked onto the next shuttle. Returning to the airport at the end of our trip was just as easy, we just booked with the concierge staff after checking out.The only negative comment is regarding the cafe as the price for a takeaway coffee was different on the two occasions I ordered. There is a coffee and danish deal which was charged at more than the advertised price (maybe tax gets added on top of the advertised price?) and when ordering just a coffee I was charged around $7.50. For the remainder of the trip I got coffee at the mall across the road ($1.60).This small issue aside we were extremely happy with our stay and will stay again when next in Singapore.","April 23, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

366,"Stayed overnight on Easter weekend for a stopover between flights. There is a free airport shuttle but on arrival into Changi we opted for a cab as it was easier after a day of travelling. It was SGD $20 from terminal 1 and took less than half an hour. Arriving early evening the lobby was relatively quiet but check-in took a little longer than usual. As we booked using points Le Club upgrades were not offered. The room on the 14th floor was modern and a good size with a view out to the strait of Singapore. The bathroom was a little dated and the shower over the bath was horrible. I’d rather forgo a bath for a separate shower but this seems to be standard in Singapore hotels of this age. The air conditioning was adequate but very noisy. The Le Club welcome gift was a fruit platter. We ate at the bistro next to the pool which was a nice setting, somewhat spoiled by screaming children in the pool but I guess that’s to be expected. Service and food were both good. The gym is open 24 hours and is well equipped with modern cardio machines and plenty of weights. Rather unusually the room, mini bar and gym all lacked bottled water. The pool is open 6am - 10pm. Getting in an early swim before flying was fantastic. On departure we caught the free shuttle to Changi which departed right on time and wasn’t busy at 7:30am on a Saturday. Overall the Mercure Roxy was better than expected and I’d probably stay again on a stopover. ","April 20, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

367,"We had not been here for a few years and were surprised by how much development has taken place over that time. there is now plenty of restaurants and shopping not too far from the Roxy. The welcome from the duty manager was very friendly.We only stayed one night this time and on eating regretted not haven slated for our return to Singapore in two weeks time. as it is a little old and well away from the CBD you get good value in aspire terms for this hotel. It is an excellent option for an airport hotel as it is only 15 minutes or less away and free hourly shuttle. There is also a shuttle to the nearby mrt for easy access to the more touristy areas of Singapore.Good rooms can be had for well less than 200$ a night.e were upgraded to a suite overlooking the sea. It is older style but the bed was excellent, the bathroom very good, very good big Tv, and plenty of room. We had a very good meal at their Chinese restaurant. The executive lounge on the 17 floor is functional more than comfortable. Drinks from 6:00 to 8:00 are limited in selection and the canapés just a little better than ok but as part of the package we enjoyed a cold beer and drinkable red wine. Th breakfast in the lounge was not so good, little selection. We would go to the main restaurant for breakfast next time.The pool for the price paid is very good, large enough to swim a few laps in and also with plenty of sun lounges. The bar is small but nice to have a drink by the pool.Overall, if we are after value for money in Singapore, we will return.","April 15, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

370,"I was put up here by AirFrance when my flight from Singapore was delayed. It’s a satisfactory hotel for something not too far from the airport on a stopover. I was surprised to find a smartphone called a Handyphone sitting on a charger on the desk facing my bed. Apparently it’s a device to help steer consumers to restaurants, bars, and activities in Singapore. Sort of a local TripAdvisor, but on its own hardware that looks like a converted Samsung Galaxy(?). The problem is that because it’s on a smartphone platform, it’s equipped with a camera and a microphone. Frankly I don’t want to stay in a hotel room with someone else potentially having access to a camera and microphone, even though I’m sure they would say it’s completely innocuous. I put it into the room safe. I would have given this hotel 1 star because of this issue, but the staff were so friendly and professional that would be unfair. So if you decide to stay here, remember to stuff the Handyphone in the safe to avoid any potential privacy issues. ","April 9, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

372,"Stayed here for a couple of nights, hotel is located not far from the airport, upon arrival the reception area was very large and lovely, they have a cafe/shop in there to purchase a variety of food and drinks, check in was easy and staff pleasant, room was nice and clean with everything you could require including nice touches such as a fridge and bottled water each day even though you can drink the tap water in Singapore. The pool area was nice and the bar/restaurant near to it, they offer a good priced happy hour on drinks (5pm-7pm) staff were lovely here. Across the road from the hotel is a large shopping complex and they have chained food outlets such as kfc etc but we found another area by the hotel which had better restaurants and bars, if you leave the hotel and turn right, walk straight and then right again and along the main road you will be spoilt for choice for eateries, including an area called Katong Square which has two great bars/restaurants, highly recommend. We opted to use a taxi into the centre of Singapore and it was only 8 HKD around £6, the taxis are clean, safe, air conditioned and the drivers very knowledgeable and friendly, return taxis are also easy to locate, for this cost it’s much better than battling the public transport until the new metro line is established. Concierge also very helpful at the hotel and kindly rang our tour booking to confirm pick up times etc. Highly recommend this hotel.","April 7, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

The food is really great from Wave Bar, Breez Bar and Feast @ East; the wifi is fast and free; location is so convenient to everything, with bus stop right outside - and soon to have an MRT as well. Many of the staff remembered us from our last stay 3 years ago, Eddie and the team at Breez Bar and several staff at Feast @ East, especially. Mr Robert Tan was exceptional in his level of service - especially on the occasion of my husband's birthday. Even concierge staff remembered us. Best of all and a huge surprise was the provision of the Handy Android phone for use by guests during their stay. On fast 4G, free data included, with Facebook, Instagram, Google already pre-installed it was so easy to record excursions without hassle of getting a Singapore SIM card. A little tricky getting the photos off, though, as most cloud based storage accounts require an SMS verification and if one doesn't have access to own phone to receive, access is not allowed. There are ways and means and thanks to WeTransfer I managed to email them to myself. Could I suggest a cable be provided so that the phone can plug into a laptop and download to photos directly. Or perhaps suggestion some other means of saving them.Only home for 2 weeks and already saving for our next visit!!Thankyou to everyone at Grand Mercure Roxy - you are all awesome!","April 2, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

The price is good, service never fails me and they provide free local newspaper delivered to your door which I personally like (not all hotels do this).As I know they provide coin operated laundry, it saves me from bringing too many clothes. It costs $7 each for washing and drying and coins can be exchanged at reception.Plenty of good foods around if you don't opt for their breakfast. It has swimming pool and gym which I don't get to enjoyed. Comes with free wi-fi (and fast too) AND a mobile phone that you can use to make international phone call for free (to many destinations) and I believe it has free data allowance as well which you can bring around when exploring Singapore.Never have any problem when asking for late check out. One comment though, the room that I stayed has a slight noise when the fan is turned to medium. Will be staying there again soon in two weeks time.","April 1, 2019","6    Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy

The 1st floor restaurants were also all full. Thankfully the lounge also has a good spread for breakfast and could satisfy our hunger.

397,"The hotel provides the typical Novotel experience with good sized rooms. The biggest challenge is the location. It is in a residential area and there are no amenities. The closest atm, for example, is a 20 minutes walk in the heat towards orchard. Also, no food or dining options after 11 pm at night. If you are looking for better value for your money, choose the mercure which is basically in the same building. Also, the Novotel at Clarke quay is a much better location at similar rates. On the other hand, if Malaysian food is your thing, one of the best restaurants in town Pappa Rich is next door!","May 1, 2019","7    Novotel Singapore On Stevens

400,"We have stayed in the hotel for a night just to celebrate a special occassion. It was a smooth check in and was greeted by Kim who didn’t lose her smile all through out the check in. The hotel location is good, the Stevens MRT is walkable in about 10-15mins however they provice complimentary shuttle service to Orchard road which is great specially if you feel like going out and do a bit of shopping. Breakfast is good, and has a lot of options. They also have two pools sharing with the guests in Mercure that is just next to Novotel, they have lap pool and infinity pool. It is open until 10pm and eventhough my partner arrived late we were able to enjoy the facilities.The room itself is very comfy, our room doesnt have bathtub compared to all Novotel I have stayed in Asia, but I guess it’s okay as everything is provided to you. Mini bar and room service I will rate as “okay”. Very limited options so we didnt use it.Overall experience is great, we had a great stay, plus they prepared a small cake for us whoch we highly appreciate.Thanks again Novotel Stevens team!","April 24, 2019","7    Novotel Singapore On Stevens

404,"My team stayed for a week at Novotel Stevens and we enjoyed every minute of it ! We got a twin bed superior room and though the space is small, it's quite functional. The toilet is separated from the shower and the sink in the middle which makes it practical. Further, aircon is very good and internet is fast. The breakfast has awesome options from bacon, to cheeses and local dishes. And what's more amazing is the service! I would like to personally commend the head person at The Food Exchange (the buffet area of the hotel), Rayan. He is very friendly, helpful and we felt very much taken cared of! Also commending Elise, one of the servers, she's really nice and takes care of us as well. They even check on how we're doing and how the food is. The chef at the egg station is also very very nice :) I will come back to this hotel. It's very near Orchard, but its very quiet and tranquil. Conducive to long walks :) Thanks again to the staff of Novotel! I recommend to be an Accor Plus member so that you get the benefits as well :)","April 14, 2019","7    Novotel Singapore On Stevens

In fact, everything was so fine that, this year, he decided to celebrate his birthday at the same venue! Food Exchange is a classy dining place, with lots of fresh seafood. One of the main reasons that my friend chose this place to celebrate his birthday is the fresh salmon sashimi, which is incomparable! Of course, the service there is also first class. We would like to thank Deep, Tamil, Chef Kong and their team for a memorable evening. My friend thoroughly enjoyed his birthday dinner.","April 10, 2019","7    Novotel Singapore On Stevens

407,"The hotel itself is great. The styling is great and the gym and pool facilities are great. The added bonus is the laundry room that you can use whenever. I stayed on the Novotel side. The club lounge is somewhat small but is great when you go there on non busy times. The room service will get mixed reviews. You can either order it by web or by phone, however if you order byt he web they will call you back to confirm the order. They say it taked about 45 min but it came faster. However on the second time when I used roomservice they completely forgot my order and I called them twice to remind them about it. It was a bit unfortunate. The shutte is great to the city centre but the public transport bus is faster. The shuttle gets stuck at the mall where there are other tourst busses loading passengers, so most of the time is just spent time sitting and waiting to get off.So the hotel is great and facilitiues good. Location wise a bit out of the tourist path but good location for business travellers.","April 8, 2019","7    Novotel Singapore On Stevens

436,"This was our second stay at this hotel and will also be the last. This booking was made over 6 months ago. Had three double rooms booked for three people. Arrived about 7pm after a 14 hour flight was checked into our rooms on the 4th floor. All three rooms were smoking room, which we did not request. I called down to the front desk and spoke to a lady and advised her that we did not book smoking rooms, having asthma and other health issue that the smoking would trigger we did not want to stay in the rooms. Guest services lady couldn't care less she just kept saying that they were totally booked up or that house keeping could refresh our room. I then asked if they are totally booked why is it that when  I check booking.com they still had rooms listed for the night? I then asked so what your saying is you 100% don't have any rooms available tonight? I was told that's correct they do not have anyrooms as they are fully booked. After being brushed off after several calls from the room and been put on hold so she could check with the manager I was finally told by guest services that she had spoken to the manager and we should bring our luggage and come back downstairs. So after dragging our luggage back downstairs again we had to line up and wait to be served . The guest services agent that I was speaking to on the phone and manager were nowhere to be seen. Once we were served again we were told that yes there are non smoking room available but that it would be twin rooms. We took the twin rooms and went back up to the 7th floor. So beware you may find yourself in a smoking room that you haven't booked. If you are allocated the wrong room by no fault of your own you will be expected to move all of your luggage with no offer to help. Guest services needs to take health concerns more seriously.

Last time we visited Singapore, we stayed at Marrison hotel, which is closest to Bugis Junction, but the bed and the room is too small for us and free breakfast is so disappointing that we skipped them. I decided to stay at Ibis and we were happy with our choice. The room and the bed was much bigger than Harrison’s although we had to walk more than 15 minutes to Bugis MRT.

440,I have stayed in this hotel several times over many years. The quality of service and facilities have remained consistent. Over the years they have provided more food in the one hotel outlet through the day although this is limited by the size of the dining facilities and that the captive clientele. Currently there was a very competitively priced Thai Buffet at lunch time. In addition the Restaurant gives a 20 % off main food items for Accor Members as long as you are in-house and can prove it ( normally to refer them to front desk/reception). Take care with room maintenance if some of the previous guests had requested the bathroom light and shaver socket be fixed I would not have had to! Lighting in the room is exceptional. East to turn everything on/off and the brightness makes any reading relaxing and easy. The hotel provides everything you need in a basic hotel room in which you are mostly out during the daytime if on business.,"June 21, 2019","8    ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel

Though my husband and my father are members of Accor still they didn’t allow late chk out at 4 which we expected as we had a late flight and we had aged parents with us.

No staff in the lobby at all except busy check-in people. No maps of the immediate area, but there were maps of the whole city. I chose this hotel partly because other reviewers mentioned the 6 vegetarian restaurants in the building next door. Sadly, they serve only unidentifiable Chinese stuff, and there is no one at any of them available to explain what anything is. We found a little Western food in the area, and two Thai places a block down to the left and across the street. The restaurant in the hotel featured ""Local Chinese Favorites"" which is insane because there are 100 restaurants nearby serving those wretched favorites. No wonder they have few customers.

I have also made numerous requests from my end and Rebecca always tried her best to assist me.The stay at ibis started with the exceptionally good service from the front desk. During check in, I asked the staff if there’s any baby bathtub to be used at the hotel and I was not surprise hearing the answer no as 3 stars hotel usually do not have one provided. The duty manager, Indra (I hope I get the name right) overheard our conversation and came over to attend to us. He mentioned that it is a good idea to have one at the hotel for guest and went off to buy one for our use. The one he bought is also suitable for a one month old as it comes with an adapter for the baby to lie on. I am truly impressed as my boy gets to have a sweet bath at the hotel. The manager also heard from us that we are holding a full month celebration for our boy and hence gave us the possibility of a late check out. With 3 young kids, we truly appreciate these check out as we do not need to hurry so much after the event to pack our bag. During the stay, we realized that the room are always tidied up and we also had our bar replenished (which we didn’t expect too)As for the full month celebration, we were truly astonished with the setup and decoration put up by the staff. Many of my guests also complimented the food served as the food was placed on induction cooker and the food were all warm and delicious. The head chef and director of sales also came down before the start of the event to ensure that everything is in place. This is true teamwork of the management and staff. I really have to say that the celebration is truly value for $ and I will definitely recommend it to others looking for a function to be held.Initially I was a little apprehensive about staying and holding the celebration at ibis but ibis has truly show me that a 3 star hotel can have a 6 star service!Thank you everyone for the great stay and celebration !

480,"Our 2nd intl trip last year was at Singapore. We choosed Ibis Bencoolen as our Hotel to stayed in 4 days 3 nights. Because my friend was an accor member that time got big discounts. Imagine we check in for 5 rooms for the group of 13. We travelled always with friends and loved ones.Our iterinary was Sentosa,Universal Studio, Merlion park,Singapore national museum and side trip going to Johor,Malaysia. I was amazed on their perks, especially the beep card access cards that can be re load. It can be used for travelling MTR and electronic fare at the bus. Also can be used to purchased some goods and foods at 7 eleven. They have also a good spot for wifi. And near to the biggest shopping market known "" Bugis "". It was 10 mins walking from the hotel. And 20 mins walking going to MTR. While going to Singapore National Museum it took as 45mins walking. This place was an earth friendly hotel because they are glass container for drinking water they do not use plastic bottle. We experienced their intercontinental breakfast to choose with. I missed the kayak toast jam and marmalades. Their room was neat and clean a compact place. You can unpack all your clothes and hang it on their closet. Even you left your valuables things it still intact when you go back to your room. Everyday there was a room service to replace your used towels and some toiletries. All the staffs at the hotel was courteous and hospitable even we are Filipinos they are all gracious to us. Highly recommended this hotel if had trip going to Singapore.","March 11, 2019","8    ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel

483,"We've stayed at this Ibis many times and it continues to be a reasonable hotel with most things you need. The room is small but adequate, unlike many other hotels in Singapore. It's very well located, reasonably close to Bugis and Bencoolen MRT stations and lots of bus routes. The only issue is that, sometimes, it gets very pricey for what it offers. When that happens, we look at other places but we haven't found an ideal replacement yet.","February 24, 2019","8    ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel

This was the only negative we had about the hotel. The best thing was the location. Close to three subway stations all within a 5 - 8 minute walk from the hotel. We used the subway constantly. Tip buy an EZ link card rather than the Tourist card, muc( more cost effective. It was also close to the shopping in Bugis street, and there was a Hawker market behind the hotel, a short walk away.Our booking included a daily free breakfast, and there was a decent selection for different nationalities.

491,"We booked this hotel for its location, and we will be back for the amenities and the buffet breakfast. The hotel is directly above the Novena MRT station, which makes getting around Singapore super easy. And the buffet breakfast was a very pleasant surprise. Not only can you have the usual western breakfast items, including a custom made omelet, but you can enjoy Asian breakfast items as well, ranging from nasi goreng to congee and baozis. But the real surprise was the infinity pool on the roof. The views are almost 360° from the harbor and the financial district to the green reservoir area to the north. Truly spectacular! My only complaint is that where is virtually no signage in the malls downstairs to indicate which mall exit leads to the hotel. I suggest you memorize the shop/restaurant you pass on your way to the mall/MRT station so you can find your way back to the hotel.","June 4, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

Gym was a decent size with barely anybody using it. Service was friendly, although I had to reset my room card every time I came back, which was annoying since It meant I had to go down to the reception desk every time. They offered a baby crib at no extra charge which is quite convenient. Breakfast had a nice selection including noodle bar and egg station. The hotel is well situated with a shopping mall next door and surrounded by many dining options. Metro station is steps away which can take you almost anywhere.

500,"As a gold member of Marriott Bonvoy, I was expecting a very welcoming vibe but not getting one instead of a sour face from the front desk, also had an issue with the breakfast too. However these issues was resolve with an immediate rectification from the duty manager ""Mun"". She did take her time to explain and solve the issue of this fussy customer. She handled pretty well.The breakfast was a little messy as the restaurant is kinda packed and our table was hijacked by another family while we were taking of food from the buffet. Anyhow there was another vacant uncleaned table and we asked if we could sit, and was allowed. Then the waiter took the serviette from the floor and wipe the watermarks on the table. I didnt bothered and sat the next chair as it was a 4 person table. I was not impressed at all on the waiter's doing.Was given an early check in and late check out which was very helpful as our flight is at 11pm, gave us extra hours to explore the city. Room is very clean, hot pressure shower, great TV channels, etc.No doubt the MRT is located right below the hotel but the down side is you need to ask around on the hotel exact entrance where you need to walk through shops and stair and a medical center lobby to reach the 1st lift system (hotel is a dual lift). The hotel lobby is located on the 22nd floor, guest room starts from the 23rd floor.Overall it is recommended, but could explore other Marriott family brand before coming back to Courtyard Novena.The best part is their air-conditioning wall controller is those normal type!","April 21, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

Pleasant surprise and not disappointed. Located near MRT with internal connection to a shopping mall. The hotel was a good choice for us. Quite new so everything still look rather fresh and clean. We met a very helpful concierge who recommended us places to eat. The rooftop pool was sufficient for short laps. Gym was pretty simple. Service was great... all the staff were courteous and professional. I'm guessing given space in Singapore is a luxury commodity, we do notice it from the size room.

This is no issue if you are out all day but if you do it several times a day becomes a bit of a pain. I got upgraded based on status to a better room but I was surprised at how small it was. Again not a big issue and understand based on land costs in Singapore. The gym is a let down. Some cardio machines and free weights but not much room to do anything.

Breakfast had plenty of choices and all the staff members that I interacted with, were polite and helpful. Special mention goes to Lilly, who walked me to the guest elevator after checking me in and even pressed the floor button for me. I thought this was a very nice gesture, considering this was a limited service property and I was a Bonvoy nobody.If i had a criticism it would be that the restaurant design was open to the reception desk and the guest elevators making the already-small lobby felt even more cluttered and noisy. I also dislike that access to the roof-top bar is only through the guest elevators, this means outside visitors to the bar might gain access to guest room floors.But overall I was impressed with the hotel and looking forward to returning.","February 17, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

Located right next to a shopping centre and MRT is great as there are shops and restaurants right there.My only comment would be that the rooms are quite compact (which didnt bother me) but might be problematic for others.","February 13, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

519,"Since Singapore is short on Marriott properties I thought I'd give this Courtyard a try for a short stay as the price was right (about 30% less than the other Marriott properties) and the location was convenient enough. in short, for a budget conscious traveller who does not need to work from the room, this property would be fine. The hotel is new, clean, and the shower is powerful and hot ... just what you need after an 18 hour flight. However, if you are in Singapore on business then there are a few significant drawbacks to this property. (1) There is *no* desk in the room or a proper desk chair. There is only a small glass table and a bench seat near the window. This is VERY uncomfortable and inconvenient if you are trying to get any work done. (2) The walls are paper thin. I could hear the conversation of the guests in the room next to me and they were just talking at normal voice level. (3) The rooms are very small ... even for Singapore standards ... there appears to be no bigger rooms even if you want one. (4) There is no Executive Lounge or complementary meeting room. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel to someone on a budget who is on holiday. For a business traveller, there are many better choices for the same or more expense.","February 12, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

520,"Pros:- Quite well-designed for a Courtyard. Rooms are small but manageable, service is efficient.- The views from the rooms really are excellent, even in a city like Singapore with many skyscraper hotels. Floor to ceiling windows of course and the upside of the Novena location is that your views are uninterrupted. To think that I could see as far as Marina Bay from the rooftop pool was very impressive.- Novena location has its upsides. The hotel is right on top of the MRT and there are several malls around it so there’s a lot of convenience to be had.Cons:- The downside to Novena is that you’re not super close to most of the things you want to be close to - business, shopping, nightlife and restaurants all require travel. Novena is predominantly a medical and residential neighbourhood.- The hotel needs to rethink its toiletries. 22mL is the smallest bottle size I’ve ever seen at a hotel and is not even enough for one person to take one shower, let alone for two people who may want to shower twice in one day. Of course one can always call reception and ask for more to be sent up but who wants to do that every day?- The rooftop pool, while with impressive views, is quite small and not very pleasant for either swimming or lounging. The Urbana bar next to it is even more disappointing - service from the girl who greeted me on both occasions was very odd and disjointed, and the chilli crab pizza they serve is terrible.","February 10, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

525,"We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Novena on 3 separate occasions last year, the last visit in late Dec for a total of 9 days. We thoroughly enjoyed all of our stays at this centrally located hotel. There are many restaurants, eateries and a couple of malls nearby, plus sheltered access to the MRT station. The hotel is relatively new so the rooms and facilities are in pretty good condition. We stayed in an accessible room which was bright, clean and cheery; although the room was compact in size, there was ample space to manoeuvre our wheelchair. More importantly, because of the open-concept room design, we appreciated the very efficient drainage and ventilation systems in the bathroom as this ensured that the room did not smell damp or musty. We adored the lovely orange and sandalwood toiletries!As Marriott Platinum members, we enjoyed various benefits including complimentary breakfast, drinks and hot food during evening cocktail hours. My husband especially enjoyed the small treats (popcorn, cookies, lemon tea etc.) given by the hotel during evening turndown service. We also experienced friendly and warm guest service during our stays, especially from associates Yvonne, Catherine H, Lily and Stella. The breakfast team manager Edwin Lee and Nina, as well as Executive Chef John Chye and Cai Ling should also be commended for their exemplary service, making for great dining experiences. We also wish to thank the hotel's Executive Asst Manager, Mr Andrew Lee, for reaching out to us during our stay and treating the guests like VIPs.Overall, great value for money. Highly recommended.","January 30, 2019","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

The room was very clean and had everything one could need, i suggest getting a high floor as the view is spectacular, of course you could just go up to the rooftop bar and infinity pool but nothing beats waking up to the view from your room. The hotel staff were excellent, on my first day i consumed all the water and the hotel put 4 bottles everyday after without me asking. Very kind of them, its the little things. The ground floor staff were very pleasant when leaving and returning to the hotel. The hotel bar is a bit small, the pool isn't to big either but its a fantastic view as it is a infinity pool.Andrew Lee the assistant manager was also very keen to know how the stay was and very supportive. Overall one of the best stays.The location:Its a bit far from the city center but honestly it is next to the underground train which is 15 minutes to the center or a taxi is always available a bit more expensive but even faster. The mall attached to it has two supermarkets, loads of restaurant and everything one could want.

Breakfast was included per my Marriott status and the food was excellent. Location is great with MRT super close. Check in and out was also very good.So why the 4 stars? The room was really small. This was not too bad for me because I was traveling alone but there is no way I could stay there with my husband. The worst part was that there was inadequate space to store my clothes. There were NO drawers other than a tiny drawer in 1 cabinet and open 2 open shelves in the closet. The closet was very small. I know the hotel cannot change the size of the rooms but they can do something about the drawer space. I was forced to somewhat live out of my suitcase for 7 nights which is never fun or efficient. The bathroom is also very open to the rest of the room so if you have 2 people there, privacy is a bit compromised.

538,"If you are thinking of staying here but picturing a Courtyard in the US stop, because this isn’t that hotel. I stay at Courtyard frequently on business and in my experience they focus on consistency almost to a fault. Walk in to one and you have walked in to most of them, same layout, same design and same services. Great in some respects because you know what to expect but don’t apply that logic here – this is a full service hotel with a Courtyard badge.I stayed for 8 nights in November. No problems checking in at 1:00AM local time. The room was spacious, and very nicely appointed. There was a great large screen TV and a comfortable couch as well. My only two minor complaints were the lack of a proper desk, there was small glass table in front of the couch, and the doors on the bathroom, which can better be characterized as sliding walls. I have seen similar design in other hotels that use barnyard types doors for the bathroom. I was traveling alone so it really didn’t matter but does one ever need a full view of the toilet from the bedroom? Why does the wall slide? I have no idea why walls and doors have fallen out of design favor. Don’t let it stop you though, minor gripe on my side that I don’t like from a design perspective.The hotel has a full restaurant at the lobby level, and again for those from the US, this is not your Courtyard. Full breakfast buffet and restaurant service at other meals. I only had breakfast but the food was excellent, the service was prompt and there was an array of western and eastern choices. I must also mention they have room service. When you fly 24 hours and have your body clock off by 13 hours sometimes the idea of someone bringing your food sounds good. I ordered dinner a couple of times and the service was prompt, 30 minutes at most and the price was reasonable. It was nice to have it as an option. I know it is typical for many hotels but not for a Courtyard.I didn’t get to make much use of either the bar, gym or pool but regardless you should make your way to the roof for spectacular views of Singapore. I went up one afternoon to watch a major storm roll in. My last night I went for a drink at the bar and the view of Singapore was awesome, I have the pictures to prove it. The bar was a bit pricey but reasonable given the location and on the Thursday night I visited the drinks were two for one, making them a bargain. Service was excellent again, very attentive.Great part of all of this was the value. I was originally booked in another hotel where the nightly rate was north of $450 Singapore. Thinking that was excessive I did some research and found this hotel for half the price and it was worth every bit of it. It has only been open for a bit over a year and may age with time but who cares – it isn’t aged now and a great value.I feel like I am being a bit too effusive here but if you travel frequently you understand how pleasant it is to roll the dice on a hotel, so to speak, and be happy with the result. First world problem I suppose but flying 24 hours for a business trip and then staying some place terrible is not much fun. No worries here with this hotel, book it, save some money and be happy.","December 22, 2018","9    Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena

553,"Great location in Clarke Quay, next door to the MRT station Fort Canning (downtime line) and handy having a 7/11, supermarket and starbucks downstairs. We found taxi drivers would get lost if you asked them to go to the hotel, but we soon learnt to ask to go to the UE Building instead. We stayed on the 11th floor and had no complaints about noise etc. Was very quiet day and night. We used the pool a few times and always found it to be clean. Staff were all very friendly and the breakfast provided on weekdays was a nice touch (food selection not excellent - mainly just pastries, cereal and toast). Bed's were comfortable, showers and bathroom good, air con worked very well but overall we were a bit underwhelmed by the apartment. I'm usually quite easy to please but I just expected some nicer finishes as the pictures online show an open plan apartment with adjoining kitchen, rug in the living room etc. Our apartment was nothing like this. It was very bare, uncomfortable couches and the kitchen was in a tiny room tucked away. Our fridge had a bad fish smell to it and i noticed the mattress provided in the baby cot was moldy. The apartment itself had a bit of an old musty smell to it.Would I stay here again? Yes, probably. As mentioned earlier, location was good and the price was excellent for a 2 bedroom apartment in the heart of the city.","March 31, 2019","10    Park Avenue Clemenceau

Just a few minor things that bothered us1. Perhaps our flat (2 story 4 bedroom) wasn't used as often, it wasn't cleaned thoroughly when we arrived. The stairs were quite dusty2. There was only 1 unit of hair dryer in the big flat, definitely not enough for all of us to use3. The shower stall door doesn't shut properly, so water keeps on leaking out 4.

564,"We stayed 8 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment. 2 adults and 2 children. We were pleasantly surprised to find 2 single beds in the second room even though our booking on Agoda had only advertised one bed. It was spacious for what is usually available in Singapore. 2 bathrooms although big step into bath tub for one of them.Made use of the combination washer dryer almost every day but it does take a long time to dry and can only handle small load to dry.Stove and microwave available but only limited cookware. But the Hawker food centres are so cheap that we didn't really need to make use of it.Very close to Fort Canning MRT. Just around the corner. Close enough that using MRT from airport is feasible even with luggage (only 1 change of line needed). Note children under 7 travel free, but as a tourist, 7 and over is full fare (but still very cheap anyway). Chinatown is 1 station away. Copious cheap food options there. Pool was great and hardly used in January. In room smartphone with free unlimited 4G internet and free calls to some countries. It is basically modified android interface. Can act as wifi hot spot for your own phone. Need to download hotspot app as access to settings menu limited. A bit fiddly as I found hot spot would activate but as soon as you activated screen again it would turn off. Best to turn it on then leave it in bag untouched for rest of day. Great battery meant hot spot could last all day. Good as it has proprietary charger (not USB). Breakfast actually surprisingly good. Numerous pastries, toast, muffins, congee, cereals, tea, coffee, boiled eggs. Not available Sat or Sun. Cold Storage supermarket underneath apartments open till 10pm each night. But expensive compared to Australia. Overall. Very happy. Excellent location. ","January 31, 2019","10    Park Avenue Clemenceau

567,"This hotel is perfect, it is in such a perfect location, heaps of restaurants of all nationality are within very close walking distance. The hotel is centrally located to all areas of Singapore and due to the taxi stop for the UE building, everyone (Grab drivers and taxi) knows where it is. The hotel room was perfect for us, we were in a 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom suite and it was ample size, the fact that both showers were able to be used at the same time with no interruption to pressure or hot water was perfect. We were lucky enough to check in early which was a perfect but had we have not been able to we could have left our bags and visited one of the many restaurants in the area. There is a convenience store (7/11) on the ground floor which is also perfect for that quick drink or snack (Ben & Jerry's). The rooms are extremely clean and serviced every second day, breakfast is provided for free on a Mon-Fri, It is not fancy but certainly plenty of choice.

Pool was very nice, we were normally the only people using it which was great. It was just across from MRT. A grocery shop was in the same complex, which was great.Clarke quay was a short stroll away and lots of place to eat nearby.

590,"Cons: 1) The entire shower must be re-modeled. There is a serious design flaw as water leaks from the shower every time you take one. We had to use towels in the floor and by the shower curtains to prevent the leaking. 2) Shower water pressure is weak, even though there are three settings in the hand-held shower head. And the water heater could not handle two people showering back to back. Water often got tepid to cold after baby bath and an adult shower. 3) Breakfast is poor. Quite embarassing, actually. No real choices, and lots of stale, leftover pastries. They should not offer it at all if that is the best they can do. It is already only offered Monday to Friday (not on public holidays and weekends) 4) It would be great to have trained staff there 24/7 like any other hotel. We arrived on Christmas Day, and there was no trained receptionist at all at the desk. They left a staff who was clearly not a trained receptionist, who fumbled through the paperwork for check in. The same happened when we were checking out on a Saturday. The same untrained staff member checked us out, and couldn’t offer any help with three large suitcases, which my wife and I had to drag along with a baby in stroller. 5) the apartment’s phone never worked and they could not really fix it. Pros: The location is superb, and the suite is quite a big space for Singapore. The staff was attentive, though a couple of times we had to ask twice for things. the Handy Phone was nice and it gave the opportunity to be in touch with my family when I was at work.

The location is handy to Clarke Quay, China town and Orchard Rd.Breakfast was included but with so many places to eat in Singapore we ventured out each morning.

604,"A very warm welcome from Hamid when we arrived. Unfortunately, that was the only day we saw him during our stay. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to the convenient Eunos MRT station. Enroute there, Geylang Serai Market offers great food. The hotel room was small but adequate and clean. The bottled water and fridge are excellent amenities. Our room was above the hotel front entrance. Unfortunately, we heard many night conversations when guests (?) stood outside to talk. Also, we had some loud talking, door slamming neighbors on our floor. The hotel had no control over these minor inconveniences; therefore, we did not complain. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you Hamid and Louie. On the side, we took a taxi (vs the very convenient/efficient MRT) to the airport for an early morning departure. It only took about 20mins. What was interesting was that the meter gave us one price and with a flick of the driver's wrist, a higher price registered on the meter. Not sure if this is acceptable or not given there was no mention of a flat airport transportation rate when we got into the taxi. ","March 2, 2019","11    Aqueen Heritage Hotel Joo Chiat

The lobby always has lemongrass incense going which I loved.The sleeping room itself was very small, but we didn't spend much time there and it was fine for two people. The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept VERY well. The little bathroom has a terrific shower, and the room amenities (fridge, hot water kettle) were great. The room also has plenty of outlets and places to charge devices.Loved the area: we found a great place with a few delicious food stalls for breakfast, the grocery store and 7/11 were right next to the hotel, and we could easily walk to a bus stop or train station to get around the city. We were probably a 30 minute ride away from everything we wanted to see and do, but I'd still stay there again.

My son and I had curry and roti bread nearly every morning which cost $1 Aus from just around the corner from the hotel. The rooms are small but adequate for a couple or single traveller. There are adjoining rooms that would suit a couple with 2 kids. Mr Hamid Haron, the duty manager was a stand out for the trip and made every effort to assist us in getting to know the area. The airport shuttle also stops at the here for $9 one way trip, the hotel also advertised a travellers SIM card which is $12 for 100gig and 1 week. The location is about 30 minutes on public transport to the heart of the city.

I stayed for 4 nights and had a peaceful and restful stay throughout.

We don’t expect much from a 3 star hotel but what we received was beyond 3 star. We were welcomed at the very start of checking in. The management has even thought through the best room to cater to the function as we had people coming in and out from our room to help us get ready for our wedding. They provided us with extra keys even helped us with our things, carrying them for us and keeping it safe too. They even allocated the room next door for our bridesmaid just so it would ease the process. They did whatever they can in helping us ensuring the event is smooth sailing. The beautiful interior too is above the average 3 star. We did not expect such professionalism and tip top customer service leaving us singing praises and fun loving memories for us to reminisce.Thank you soooo much Duty Manager Mr Hamid & the rest of Aqueen Joo Chiat staff!

The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful especially the Hotel Manager Hamid. My stay in the hotel is relaxing and comfortable.

639,Stayed twice at this hotel – one night each time for between flight stopovers. It is a short taxi ride from the hotel – cost $16 (23 in Friday afternoon peak hour). The location is great with several food hawker food centers and small restaurants (great murtabak) nearby. There is also a large supermarket almost next door. It is easy to hail taxis outside. Rooms are small but really well appointed with lots of shelves and powerpoints. Good bathrooms with great showerheads. Free wifi. They also stored a suitcase for a week free of charge. Noise can be a problem. First room was opposite a carpark and market trolleys started at am and were incredibly noisy. However the second room had no window so was quiet – except for the party which arrived at 10pm and banged their room doors and chatted loudly for the next two hours. Staff are helpful.,"February 23, 2018","11    Aqueen Heritage Hotel Joo Chiat

Unfortunately, there was no heating anywhere in the hotel and Hong Kong was very cold during our stay so we were very cold in the room. We were told this drop in temperature was most unusual.

641,"If you want to experience a bit of Singapore other than Orchard Road or the central business district the Aqueen in Joo Chiat Road is a good choice. The surrounding area captures a feeling of what Singapore was in the past. The hotel is located in an area of colourful two storey shop-houses, on a street with plenty of food choices, including a great vegan restaurant, and laundromats if you need to freshen up your clothes. It is next to a supermarket, and is not far from the MRT. The rooms are spotless and the staff helpful. We were travelling with bicycles. The manager saw us arriving and came out to welcome us, and show us to the place they had found for storing them when we weren’t using them. The staff were always prompt and helpful when we need to get the bikes. The fundamental questions are: would we stay there again and would we recommend it to our friends. The answer to both is a definite yes.","February 6, 2018","11    Aqueen Heritage Hotel Joo Chiat

Nice quiet room as requested and really comfy beds. Tea / coffee making including small fridge were a bonus. Felt safe as well. Only mild criticism is the floor carpet was a bit well worn. The location was a bit betwixt and between Eunos and Paya Lebar metro stations, both a bit of a walk. Eating places abundant on Geylang Road, but only if you care for local fishy food. Being vegetarian was incredibly difficult, little if any choice, but thats Singapore rather than the hotel.

My stay is still continuing (early morning of june 30, 2019 at 0030 hrs).We are in room 411, the ACs did not work on june 28,2019 night but we managed somehow. Again tonight (june29,2019) the ACs stopped working at about midnight. We called the reception and the guy at reception gave us an option to change the room to 211 and asked us to come and collect the keys from reception. Naturally I go down to collect the keys to 211. I asked the guy how can he be sure that the ACs are working in 211. The guy mr.mohd Jamir fired on me saying the following:1. Don't make fun of me2. I have only this information from the management that ACs hv a problem I can't help you more. 3. Say what you want and go away.Such language... I hv never ever heard in hospitality industry.I asked his name... he said go give my feedback.I told him may be something I said made u feel bad.. I am sorry..let's start from the beginning as we r probably from the same country.He said I hv some work... please go away and take the other room.Lastly if the management already knew that there was some problem with the AC why didn't they sort it out before hand.The worst experience ever. Lastly, there are ants in the room.Bathrooms are tinyThe worst 'security staff' ever.Do avoid for your own self respect.

Dental kit are also upon request. Bottled water will only be replenished upon request and only once a day refill is allowed can be improved.

We were using Grab/Gojek online taxi every time, so we had no issues. Wait, there was one. But it's minor. The apartment location in GPS was not recorded correctly, so we frequently experienced taxi drivers had to call/text us to find the location. On the map it's located in ""Havelock Road"", where in fact it was not. Havelock Road is the big road, whereas this apartment's entrance was located in ""Old Havelock Road"" which is a small road branching out from the big one. Anyway, after the first confusion, we managed to direct the taxi. Since it is a relatively new apartment, many taxis might not know this place. But I reckon, this would be less and less problem in the future. Ok back to the unit. I found the place was clean and neatly organized. The aircon was cold, and the shower was hot (important!). It's also quite spacey, so we had no problem in storing our luggages or stuffs around. On the facilities, it has small swimming pool on the rooftop. It's only 12 m in length and 1 m in depth. It's located next to the guest lounge/restaurant, so you might not feel ease being watched by those having breakfast. For me, no problem. I had good time doing my weekly exercise and swam quite many laps in the morning. For the joggers, the apartment is actually located near to Clarke Quay. Where you can find nice jogging track along the river, and leading to Boat Quay, Fullerton and Merlion. Nice scenic track. Just look at your map and find the closest route to the track. It's about 500m walk going there. No big deal. You'll have fun afterwards. Just across the apartment, you'll also find a mini market. Very convenient for you to buy daily supplies. Outside the hotel they also have vending machine for snacks and beverages. I found it useful, as you might feel hungry on midnight and you had no mini bars in the room. Overall I feel very comfortable staying in this place. If you plan to go to Singapore for a extended days, and main objective is not for shopping, you can consider this apartment. As it's relatively new, the owner might give you good price/discount over Agoda (as I experienced). So all in all, I would recommend this place.","January 31, 2019","12    Louis Kienne Serviced Residences - Havelock

698,"Stayed almost 4 months in this service apartment. This is not a premium or luxury service apartment as its advertising suggest.Pro:- Nice marbled entrance with uniformed staff (but no proper lobby)- Nice small rooftop pool- Plenty parking availableCons:- Location is not that close to any MRT at all. (min. 15 mins walk to MRT)- Terrible room construction, thin walls. You can hear everything next door.- Terrible facilities. The indoor ""guest lounge"" is only used as a breakfast area and is closed otherwise the entire day. The outdoor ""guest lounge""/sitting area in the tropics is not even equipped with a fan...- Terrible breakfast selection. Really cheap and small selection with no change.- No service lift. Guests and hotel staff share 2 tiny lifts, so the lifts do get clogged up with maintenance workers and housekeeping during the day- The advertised ""gym"" is non-existent - a straight ad fraud.Service/Staff- Very friendly front desk staff- Very friendly breakfast servers- Below average room service (not vacuumed regularly)- Extremely rude security staff (there is an Indian lady who is extremely rude, i almost got into a fight with her - she should be trained in basic customer service)- Poor management. Feedback is met with silence and non-action. Seems like they only react when its made public on the internetSummary:Its an overpriced budget service apartment that advertises itself to be 4-star luxury. Nothing of that sort.

Also, the hotel gives you a cortesy phone where you can use and call any taxi, so although you are not in the city centre we haven’t had any trouble.We had 2 bed apartment with 3 bathrooms, they were small but great (all with shower, not bath). The swimming pool is at the topfloor. It’s a narrow pool and shallow but it is great! My kids fully enjoyed it! You have nice views from there so it was great spending some time there until the end of the day (it closes at 11pm). Also, we used it 3 times and always we were the only ones! Great! The breakfast is basic, we tried once and decided to have breakfast at the apartment. There is a 7/11 store nearby for buying basic stuff.Overall, great experience!

714,"I last stayed here about three years ago after the hotel reopened following a complete refurbishment and rebranding. I just had a great return weekend so thought it deserves another review.This is probably the best value Marriott hotel in Singapore and you have to judge it by the standard it sets itself: the room rate and the Four Points brand. As such I thoroughly recommend it. They actually improved the offering since it reopened.Staff are excellent throughout from check in to check out. It feels like a good place to work. As a Titanium Bonvoy member I get a few benefits including a minor room upgrade to a riverview room (the hotel has a few suites and I got one last time), late checkout at 4pm, breakfast as the welcome gift, and - best of all - two hours of drinks in the bar from 6-8pm. This is new since my last stay and makes up somewhat for the lack of a lounge (though Four Points don’t generally have Executive Lounges).The room feels well maintained and has a coffee plunger for early mornings and the full range of bathroom amenities including shaver and toothbrushes.Breakfast buffet is excellent for a FP and reflects the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore with all Western and Asian tastes catered for. Snacks were served with bar drinks during happy hour but they wouldn’t make a meal. Some people complain that the hotel is not on the MRT. If it was then it would not go for S$160++ a night and give you two hours of beer/wine/spirits in this expensive country. I happily walked to both Chinatown and Clarke Quay in 15 minutes. If it was priced higher then you’d be comparing it to the Sheraton or the Vagabond but as it is this is now my go-to hotel in Singapore for a quick weekend away that doesn’t break the bank. I’m back for three nights in August. ","June 17, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

We had dinner outside by the river, which was nice, and I could tell there were some things we could have explored across the river but we didn't have time. Overall I got the sense that this hotel wasn't situated beside a lot of things and that you'd need to make an effort to shop or see attractions.

717,"I stayed in this hotel for 7 nights and let me tell you that is far from the main attractions, the MRT is a long walk especially with the excruciating heat of Singapore about 20-25 mins walk, the closest MRT is Chinatown, the buses stop in front of the hotel and you can manage to move around in the bus.One of the greatest amenities for me was the free cell phone in the room, I took it everywhere with me and it came with 4G which it was extremely useful, also the international phone calls to the USA were free, YES, free, which is unbelievable in today's world. The front desk people were not really nice but there was a young guy that made a BIG difference for me, PRAKASH, he was really helpful and gave amazing hints about the city, on top of that he helped me with my suitcases and every time he saw me he greeted me and told me if I needed anything just to let him know. Prakash thanks for being so kind, you made my trip in Singapore better.My room was not very nice as some of the pictures posted here but it was clean and every day I got 2 free bottles of water which I really appreciated.The breakfast come with lots of options it was good. Behind the hotel is Robertson Quay and there are tons of restaurants in the area so you can choose, the walk along the river is beautiful and very safe.","June 11, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

720,"Planning to visit Singapore? Member of Marriott rewards? Suggest trying this hotel. Although our short 2 1/2 day visit was filled with lots of touring around, we found this property to be perfectly situated to mount our excursions. Within minutes you are by the Singapore River and numerous hotels and a great river boat excursion to see the wonderful skyline. The people at this Sheraton seemed genuinely caring and desiring to help you. I use ""genuine"" purposely as I have been in numerous hotel where the staff is quite ""nice"" and ""polite"" and helpful, but somehow you feel that is not how they are when they go home. The morning breakfast buffet was outstanding and plentiful and respectful of the many cultures that flock to this city. Yes Singapore is clean and seems safe - by sheer threat of penalty, but every Singaporean I spoke to said they gladly trade some freedoms to have what they have. I confess I found it appealing. So, if you go, consider the Sheraton. The rooms are nice, though a tad small, but the views were practically worth the stay alone!!","June 4, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

Check in was breeze and I was allotted a room at higher floor as requested. However, they did not have any double bed room and was allotted a twin bed room which was little disappointing. Otherwise was very happy with the amenities. Adequate toiletries in bathroom, good size bath tub, enough drinking water bottle in room. Their vending machine can have better choices for some quick bites. Did not use the in hotel restaurants but they had enough choices. Breakfast was very good with various Asian, continental and bakery options. They were also helping us to get taxis for our daily commute to the office.

722,"We opted for a river view and the room was perfect. Our request for a high level room and was accommodated. The view was nice, and we could just see the Marina Bay Sands boat. Nice air-conditioning and a fridge to keep your refreshments cold. We investigated breakfast else where, but found the hotel price for the buffet pretty comparable to local eateries. Plus the variety of the food was amazing. The pool, steam room and gym area is really nice. You can order food to the pool via a phone by the water cooler. Across the bridge there are several places to eat/drink and a 7-eleven mini mart for refreshing beverages. No close by MRT station, but GRAB taxi's (similar to Uber) are a cheap alternative. 6 Singapore dollars to Satay Street, a bit more on the return, and 18 to the airport. Normal check out is 12, but if you ask you can extend it to 2pm for no extra charge. Staff were friendly at check in/out, and we found the breakfast buffet staff exceptional.

724,"I pick this hotel for my stay during biz trip (23-24 May) since it’s quite close to my SG office + I’m Marriott SPG Addict.. Whenever I travel, I’ll always pick SPG/Marriott affiliated hotel.. I have stayed in a lot of Four Points Hotel Chain and never had this “wow” experience like this one.. Wow in a “meh” way.. First I’m actually a titanium bonvoy member (supposed to be the highest tier) so of course i expect more.. No suite upgrade offered and when i asked, they just said “it’s full”.. Then i asked for room with 1 bed but they said that i need to wait for 30 mins - 1 hour.. how come? I have checked in online, they should have prepared the room already.. So i settled with twin bed one and go to office directly.. the surprise is at late night when i came back from the office and looking to have a bath then good sleep.. The towel is full of a dust (see pic) Oh wow.. then i asked for towel replacement, the staff (chinese guy) give me the towel with a “huh” not even a greeting plus he’a busy with his phone?!? Then i noted that the carpet near the bed have hardened puke + it’s smelly OMFG (see pic).. I’m super tired already, no energy to put a complaint and it’s almost midnight so i’m going directly to the bed.. and the biggest surprise of all is the bed SUCK.. so the bed is actually not flat, worn out and kinda sunk in some place.. 2 beds actually in the same condition + it’s dusty as well.. When I woke up in the morning, guess what??? I have backpain.. the reason i give this 2 stars are - breakfast is amazing (esp smiling auntie at omelette section) and shower is pretty great.. I did complain and show this picture when i checked out and they just said “sorry, we’ll investigate”.. I paid ++ SGD 200 for this stay, only to get backpain + bad sleep.. I pay around SGD 100 for four points Jakarta / Bali and they overdelivered.. definitely blacklisted this one!!","May 25, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

725,"I am about to finish a 5 night stay at the Four Points Sheraton, Riverview, Singapore.It is a good hotel, well kept and maintained, with fantastic friendly staff. the room is a decent size, with very little outside noise (17th Floor). Straight out the back of the hotel and just across the bridge are half a dozen bars/restaurants. I can recommend ""Toby's Estate Coffee"" for breakfast. Decent portions and a proper cappuccino (similar to the great coffee we get in Melbourne) which is often hard to get in Singapore.My only suggestions for improvements are very minor gripes (1 - the bath/shower is smallish so the shower curtain ends up ""sticking to your side when you are under the shower, and the water drains along the ridge and onto the floor, which then needs mopping up......2, there are no snacks in the fridge at all, 3, the gym looks pretty small and 4, the pool looks pretty small as well).I didn't check to see if there was an Exec Lounge here (I'm not yet Platinum!).Other than that, no issues at all.You can grab a free paper on every floor each day - a nice touch. Taxi's and Grab are easy t get and pretty quick to get. The hotel is close to a lot of the action.Overall, a very pleasant stay and I'd come back again.","May 23, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

733,"My wife and I have just returned to the UK from a 13 day holiday in Singapore, where we stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton Hotel for twelve nights. We had a wonderful Holiday, seeing a lot of changes from my previous trip to Singapore in 1978. Our stay at the Four Points played a big part in making our holiday so memorable. Before we arrived, I was able to have questions answered relating to our trip by Cindy, Guest Manager, who made sure everything was in place for our arrival. She also arranged some lovely touches to our room as this was our 25th Wedding Anniversary Trip. During our stay her colleague Khoo Huei Sim, made contact to check if there was any assistance we needed. Because everything was so good at the Hotel, we had no need for help, as all our needs were met by the friendly and professional staff. Our Room had a great view of the City and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. A couple of days, we had done a lot of walking and enjoyed a lovely light supper in our room, which was not overly priced. We had a number of meals in the Hotel, from breakfast, through lunch to evening meals, either in the ground floor restaurant or adjacent Bar. All were great value and very enjoyable and it was nice we didn’t have to eat out if we didn’t want to. If we did eat out we often went to one of the local Restaurants, across the river from the Hotel via a convenient bridge. These ranged from an Italian Restaurant, through to a Sports Bar and Restaurants serving local cuisine. The Hotel location was ideal for us. We were a short walk to two convenient Metro Stations, Clarke Quay and Chinatown. At the latter we could buy travel cards, which allowed us to use buses and Metro for either 1, 2 or 3 days unlimited travel. If we wanted, we could get the 51 Bus from right outside the Hotel which took us to Clarke Quay Metro Station. Staff assisted us with their knowledge of Singapore Transport and on occasion helped us get Taxis if public transport wasn’t convenient. We are not great Pool People, but had a number of lovely relaxing times by the Pool on the 5th Floor, the advantage of an extended stay. This stayed open late, so we could have a relaxing swim at pretty much any time of day. We had one night away at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel during our stay, but I thought my wife was right. When we came back after our night away, my wife said “well that was nice, but its nice to be home”. We did feel like Four Points was like our ‘Home’ for two weeks. We felt special and spoiled. We could fault nothing. Singapore has a huge number of top Hotels throughout the City, but if we ever come back, we will look no further than the Four Points.","May 12, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

Throughout our dining experience there, they've never fail to provide their utmost service to me and my friends. They have extended their services beyond my expectation. We felt very pleasure and engaging to be able to serve by them and will definitely return to Four Point Eatery again.","April 15, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

The staff where friendly and helpful from check in to leaving. It is a lovely walk along the river all the way to the marina. There are a several places close by to across the river to eat and drink if you fancy a change from the hotel. The closest underground (MRT) at Fort Canning is a bit of a walk, if mobility is an issue then check the taxis.","April 13, 2019","13    Four Points by Sheraton Singapore, Riverview

For those that want to avoid the 20 minute walk, there is a bus line right in front or you can get a taxi or Grab very quickly.Being avid walkers in our own city, we didn’t mind it at all. Especially when the walk takes you down their beautiful river walk area. Rooms were clean and the breakfast was really good! Nice staff and decent pool. Would definitely stay here again!

756,"WE recently stayed at The Novotel for 3 nights on our return from Thailand back to NZ. This hotel is situated right next to Clarke Quay and is fairly central in Singapore, its location is great with easy access to MRT just round the corner and taxis are cheap as chips too with taxis arriving regularly at the main door, so not long to wait to get out and about.The staff were excellent, very attentive and so helpful. We changed room 3 times when we first arrived due to the fact that we were unhappy with the 1st 2 as we were too close to the lifts with the 1st room and my partner would not have slept very well & the 2nd room had a bit of a musty smell to it & being on the 20th floor again my partner had abit of vertigo so we were given a room down on the 14th floor closer to other family members on our trip. I know we were abit fussy and I was very apologetic to the reception staff but they were fantastic, being understanding about our ""issues"" and they said it wasn't a problem so we were very appreciative of their professional attitude and demeanour and for their assistance to help their demanding clients and make us happy. With regard to the room we had I thought it does look a little dated in terms of decor and could probably do with an update as we've stayed at quite a few Novotel hotels and it's probably not quite as good as others we've stayed at (sorry) but it was ok. Our 1st room was looking towards the Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands but the 2nd and our final room was overlooking the pool & city & despite the decor, the room was clean, tidy, quiet and the beds very comfortable. We had a great sleep (we had twin beds so had a bed each rather than a king bed but we were ok with that) and we had to thank the lovely lady who manned the desk opposite the check in as she helped us obtain a late check out which made a huge difference for us since we weren't due to fly out of Singapore till late and being able to depart the hotel at 4.30pm was such a big help. We were very grateful for the benefits that having a Gold Accor card can provide but I think the staff at this hotel will help all their guests the same way if possible, I cannot stress how impressed we were with the service from the staff here, they were excellent. We also ate food from the Le Rouge bar as well as had breakfast at the restaurant on our first morning and the food was lovely, very enjoyable, kids loved the pancakes! So would we stay here again? Yes Definitely!","July 13, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

Its a 2 minutes walk to Clark Quay and 15 to 30 minutes by taxi to all the major areas of Singapore. Commuting to and from this hotel is very convenient as taxis are easily available . The concierge stationed on the ground floor are always there to help. Check in was quick and hassle free after a full night flight and an early morning arrival. I was staying on the 21st floor and the city view from the room is stunning. Breakfast selection is good with a wide variety of Chinese , Western and Indian Dishes. Rooms are very very clean as is the whole of Singapore. I just found them to be a little too simple in decor but nothing to complain about. Over all the hotel staff is attentive and its was a pleasure staying at this property. Will come back again for sure.","July 7, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

Kindly thank them on my behalf. The front desk officer who checked me in is truly amazing too. Can't quite recall her name - Carrie (or Catherine)? There are annoyances which can be worked on to make the experience even better.

This was 1am in the morning, children screaming and running up and down. Totally disrespectful to other guests. Perhaps the hotel should put parents and children on specific floors so they don’t disturb people that have had long flights. Food for thought. One particular day we had to cue to get into our room as there was a function on one of the floors, we used the shopping centre lifts to skip the cue, but if your not aware of those it’s a bit frustrating.

The lounge is overlooking Clarke Quay and Marina Bay, which is really beautiful when the sun sets. There are even balconies in the lounge! Accor elite status is recognized here. Some hotels I stayed at did not really care about elite status. As an Accor platinum member, I received a room upgrade and lounge access. The location is fantastic and very convenient too, just next to Fort Canning MRT station. Chinatown station is just 1 stop away, which is linked to Chinatown Point, as well as many other buildings in Chinatown, through underground walkways. The hotel itself is directly linked to Liang Court mall, through 3 hidden elevators just next to the restaurant on level 7. It would be good if front desk staff informed guests of these hidden elevators to save guests from the trouble of going all the way down to level 1, walk out the hotel, then into the mall. I found out about these elevators when I explored the hotel. There's a good Chinese restaurant, Shin Yeh, on level 2, and a Japanese supermarket, Meidiya, on the basement. There is also a laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers just next to these elevators. There is, however, a bit of shortfall. There are too many fruit flies in the lounge.

We had a great view over Clarke Quay and along the river to Marina Bay.The staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to check if everything was ok. The premier floors are definitely worth paying for for the drinks and nibbles of an evening and a quiet breakfast (although less variety) than the main restaurant. The pool is massive with a large deck area and plenty of space to move around. Probably the deepest hotel pool I have seen also. While we didn't utilise it, there is waiter service to the pool lounges from reasonable happy hour price drinks and snacks menu.The hotel has more of a business traveller vibe however is perfect for tourists also with its friendly staff and excellent location.Definitely would recommend Novotel Clarke Quay in particular the premier floor rooms.","May 20, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

The check in procedure is fast, we have pre booked the rooms in advance. The room facilities including the amnesities are great. Room is cleaned and taken care every day. The hotel staff hospitality are great. The hotel location is so center from many places, Clark Quay restorans and pubs are walking distance, Liang Court Mall is a step away from hotel.

795,"We had room 1516 on the 15th floor. It was a Bay view with good views of Clarke Quay and we were able to see as far as the 'Garden in the Sky'. The river meanders below, overall a good view. There is a small balcony but no access for Health and Safety reasons although you can request it to be opened. The bathroom has a good sized shower and bath. There was plenty of hot water. TV had a good selection of channels, many of which were in English. Tea making facilities were good although there was no decaffeinated coffee. Lighting was subdued. It was difficult to read both the bedside controls for the lights etc and the ones by the door. In fact I had to use a small torch. As I am getting older this was perhaps also down to me.Housekeeping was excellent, prompt and efficient. The concierge desk was very helpful. My wife has a wheelchair and they were very quick to assist with ensuring we got an appropriate vehicle to and from the airport.Breakfast buffet was very good with plenty of choice. Whilst there was gluten free bread and gluten free muffins available there was no gluten free cereal. The pool is very large and whilst sitting having coffee near the pool after breakfast we met the Hotel General Manager, Alan Burrows, who was doing his morning check of the pool and surrounds. He was very approachable and said he would go and talk to the chef about the gluten free cereal. A big help to us at different times was a young man called Gerard who works at the reception desk. He was very polite and very patient. There is a supermarket, shops and eating places located below the hotel. This is very convenient if you forgot anything. The hotel is right on Clarke Quay and the location makes it ideal to visit many places, for example, if you walk through Clarke Quay central on the other side of the river it brings you out near China Town Central.most places are wheelchair accessible, especially the long walks alongside the river.","May 11, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

799,"I stayed for three nights and loved this hotel. I ate at the buffet for one lunch and two dinners and if you are staying at the hotel you get 30% off so makes it a pretty sweet deal. The Clarke Quay restaurants are just across from the hotel as is a river cruise outlet, so convenient at night time as I was a solo traveller. Always feel safe in Singapore though. The pool has two access areas, one through the restaurant and the other on the 6th level. Cabanas and pool beds were cool. I will definitely return and stay at this hotel. All service staff were very accommodating. There was a $5 charge for ice in an ice bucket which I found unusual but believe me was way cheaper having my duty free alcohol drinks in my room before heading out so was happy to pay (can’t have spirits without ice).

800,"Stayed for one night breaking up a trip back to Australia. A taxi from Changi Terminal 2 took less than half an hour and was about SGD $20.On entering on the ground floor you'll find concierge. The hotel lobby is on level 7. The check-in experience was a little frustrating - we queued in the Le Club premium line but only one agent was serving those guests so folks in the standard line were seen to quicker so guests with status were made to wait longer. Go figure... Once we were served the agent tells us we could go to level 24 to do check in in the premium lounge. Given we had waited already we declined. I suggest they should have a front-of-house greeter or more obvious signage to prevent this annoyance.We accepted an email offer of a room upgrade for SGD $49 prior to arrival. As we had booked on points complementary Le Club upgrades were not offered. The room was large and clean but looking a little dated. The room was incredibly stuffy as the A/C does not function without a keycard in the wall. I appreciate this is an environmental initiative but to make for a positive first entrance the blinds should at least be closed to keep some of the heat out. Despite the A/C being set to 16C the room never got under 25C.The bathroom was very large and had both a shower over bath and an additional separate shower. No complaints about having two showers, but it was odd. Only 2 towels were provided.There was no Le Club Platinum welcome gift, but drink vouchers were supplied.We had breakfast in the premium lounge which was a fairly average buffet. Not a lot of choice and the space around the buffet was quite cramped.The gym was very small and not well ventilated making it very stuffy. There are two treadmills and an elliptical along with weights machines. The equipment was all in good condition.The pool area I believe is shared with a neighbouring hotel. Quite strangely for Singapore the water was very cold. It was also strangely very deep at over 3.5m at the deepest end - which I suspect is why it was so cold.The location is handy in Clarke Quay with easy access to the riverfront dining and entertainment options. Overall I was disappointed with Novotel Clarke Quay and I wouldn't stay again.Side note - on our departure day we were left a letter under the door explaining that the hotel's power would be shut off at midnight for 5 hours leaving guests without power, hot water and air conditioning (in Singapore!). Had we not been departing that day already we would have left early for another hotel. That kind of inconvenience without prior warning or compensation is unacceptable.","May 3, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

806,"Seeing as Novotel is a large international chain, I was expecting a great stay, however I was severely disappointed. It took a lengthy amount of time to check in and after 15 hours of travelling we just wanted to sleep. When we came down to the buffet for breakfast it was a mad house. A lot of food hadn’t been replenished and it seemed as if they were going for quantity rather than quality. When trying to organise something through the hotel such as pillows or our luggage to be moved, we had to ring multiple times before they actually came. I don’t want to put down the employees, as working in a large hotel can be a stressful job, I think poor management is at fault. This hotel felt quite impersonal and as if it was simply just for the masses, without concern for the individual. This hotel has good bones but it could signicantly be improved by hiring more staff, and implementing an extensive training regime to ensure that all staff can provide the best service. For example, at the buffet there was long queues and it was crowded. However, by simply hiring a few more staff for this sector, the plates could be cleared quicker and the whole system would be more efficient.","April 25, 2019","14    Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay

811,"An interesting hotel. It has got the design style going on but not for the purpose intended. There was little necessity for any interaction between staff and guests - which you may like! Check in efficient. Hotels rooms groovy but tiny! Think New York style. Bathrooms very small. Bed very comfortable and regular room servicing. We got the courtyard room which helped for a sense of more space. Get Aura the robot to deliver water and teabags - heaps of fun. Restaurant good but fairly expensive. Coffee very average. (Go round to the waterfront for Toby’s Estate coffee - great but about $8 a medium!).Location wise, it’s a quiet area. I found it a little dull - easy to find restaurants and drinks on the waterfront but they were touristy and expensive. Not a hawkers stand in sight! 7/11 close by for bits and pieces. No train station close by. Taxis very easy to call from Ipad in foyer. Taxis very reasonable and accept credit cards. Nice walk along the river towards Raffles etc. Chinatown about 20 minutes away. Next time I would stay in Kampong Glam area near Haji Lane and Arab street - much more character. Pool quite crowded and small. Often shaded from high rise. I found it too cold and a little bit squeezy to be relaxed. Gym reasonable. For smokers you can smoke at the rear of the carpark and a few people had a cheeky dart on their balconies at night - but not sure if totally OK.","July 9, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

826,"It was my birthday weekend and my wife and I decided to go on staycation in this hotel which is near my previous workplace.My friend who used to visit Singapore last year stayed in this hotel which is very cosy and homey.We were warmly welcomed by Gretchen at the reception and after checking the availability of the rooms, we were advised that standard rooms are fully booked, however we are offered to get the loft room at the ninth floor. And since it’s my birthday, I was given a green coupon which I can get a bithday dessert from the resturant.The narrow hallway leading to the rooms is lined with red carpet and warmly lit.The sound-proofed room is a contemporary modern-industrial in design, with double glass panel walls separating the bath from the rest of the room and has blinds for privacy.The room is tiny, I would say, compared to the hotels I have been to, however this one is a representation of smart usage of space: open-concept wardrobe, compact vanity and fridge. Just essentials and surprisingly, sufficient for our stay. One thing that was missing in the toilet was the bidet. On the loft is where the leather sofa and tv as well as the study table and chair was. Breakfast is not included however Armando from the hotel’s restaurant Beast and Butterflies assured us that since we are hotel guests, we pay less, so we went. Breakfast buffet is at $23.54/person and is chargeable to the room. That made the experience convenient since I did not bring my wallet with me and instead of us going back to the room, Armando suggested to have our breakfast charged to the room instead. What an efficient service!For the amount of the breakfast, it’s worth it, compared to the plated breakfast in the nearby cafes which starts at $18++ not including drinks. The spread is a mix of selected local and international favourites. The focal point of the breakfast is the robotic egg station which has been queued for by the guests. The weather was gloomy so we did not get the chance to enjoy the pool at the fifth floor.That evening, after spending the whole day outside, we went to Beast and Butterflies for some drinks and we’re served by Carisa and was recommended to have the Mont Blanc as our dessert. The recommendation was excellent to our taste— not too rich and not too sweet. Check-out was smooth and overall is a great experience! Until the next time! Please help me inform your staff how great they’re doing their jobs! —Norbert","June 11, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

828,"M Social is located along the river in Singapore. It's a quiet residential area that requires a taxi or a 20 minute walk to get to an MRT station. The hotel itself was new enough, but it was small, oh so small. The rooms were so pokey that only one person could walk around the bed at once. The bathroom consisted of the toilet and shower only and the hand basin was in the bedroom. I don't like this concept. Hotel management will tell you that it was designed by Blah Blah (some wanky European designer), but I am not sure if Blah Blah has ever had to stay in this hotel. It is impractical and far too small. If you need room service, they send a little robot up with your toiletries or water or whatever you asked for - though this can take up to an hour. On the whole, I feel this place is just trying too hard. My other qualm is the hotel staff. Whilst all pleasant enough, they were all just going through the motions. None of them seem to have any passion for their country, Singapore. If I ask for local insight and hints, they should be keen to help. The most helpful staff member I encountered was a Taiwanese girl named Lily (who also had resigned and was leaving the hotel the week after our stay). For the same money, there are better options.","June 9, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

832,"Where do Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan of the twenty-first century stay when Singapore is the destination? Swanky Pop Star Pad is what we walked into first time arriving at M Social. Instead of an unimaginative urban opulence, M Social’s exterior is an explosion of energy.What we discovered during the stay at M Social Singapore: The Guest is the Darling. Right from the Reservation I emailed that was responded in no time to the airport pick-up arrangement and personalized check-in done without delay upon arrival: every M-bassador at M Social strived to save not only our time, but also to ensure that the M-experience is world-class. Our pre-booked Premier Loft is a cocktail of incredible interior work: staged into two levels is the separate lounge to laze away and the upper mezzanine to bed down after a long day out browsing the bustling city. Definitely a to-die-for-design by the French Designer, Mr. Starck; successfully orchestrated quirkiness and maverick Millienialism.You know you are (treated like) a Pop Star when every detail is a dream comes true: it is incredibly important to me to mention that every M-bassador of M Social exceeds expectation by handling Health Concern carefully. Currently one of us is on a strict Diet Program that does not allow a large number of Food Items. I stepped into Beast & Butterflies—M Social’s super Instagramable restaurant, ordered Beef Tenderloin topped with the list of the spices and ingredients to be eliminated as per the doctor’s order. I waited with a worried face as I experienced extremely poor service previously at a river-side restaurant in the neighbourhood (which I will write about separately to warn travellers; as well as my best-of-the-best Beast & Butterflies experience).An M-bassador at Beast & Butterflies: first-class Fiona flawlessly handled the handful requests. She took time to tell me that “Absolutely! Allergies should never be taken lightly. We understand.” Instantly I was at ease. Effectively helpful, Fiona did not stop at making sure the Tenderloin order was well-handled; but also asked for the List of Allowed Food Items as we were staying for a full week at M Social. As a result, every Breakfast experience was never a frustration but a feast with friends. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to the sweetest-smile Armando, (again) first-class Fiona, Keanney (for the tip of what’s hip in the city!), Sham and everyone at Beast & Butterflies for every specially set-aside fruits and food items prepared everyday (I’m not crying, you’re crying!). Though M Social is strategically city-centered, we ended up eating in almost everyday at Beast & Butterflies because everything is easier while what we want from the Asian Cuisine adventure is fulfilled; with taste to match the tongues of the Kings & Queens.Congratulations on the terrific teamwork (to William, where-to-go-when-in-Singapore Yasmin, detail-oriented Desmond at the Front Desk and Aura—the Best Bot there is!) and the legendary leadership that is a victory, Mr. Veerasamy! M Social is my true Great Gatsby experience; proof that we can have it all when we travel faraway from friends and family.","May 28, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

My room was 205 and though quite small on floor space was quite compensated for by stunning design...a chapel ceiling, arched connecting doorway and clever double-glazed bathroom walls with fine gold venetian blinds between. Great lighting effect. The bed so very comfortable with the top quality white linen and everything I needed was there. Adding to the sense of space was the private garden terrace, trees and all....on the 2nd floor! Typical Singapore.....great design and gardens everywhere. Location is excellent Robertson Quays on the Singapore River a great place to spend time, walk ,dine or enjoy fine coffee.

Surrounded by great bars and restaurants at Robertson Quay and a neighbourhood of apartments, it was nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore's shops - yet, Orchard Road was walkable. We loved the robot who served us eggs for breakfast (breakfast was great).The only slight issue was not much storage space for 2 suitcases. Our room had the bed downstairs and the living area upstairs - if that configuration was reversed, as other rooms are, that would have been much easier. If we were there for more than 2 nights next time, we will ask for a room with a living area downstairs for that reason.There was a great pool, which was nice to swim in and sit by to read - lovely pool towels and day beds.","May 24, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

840,"I stayed there early April for a night over the weekend. There was a queue at reception for check in but generally, the staff were all quite efficient and friendly. We stayed in the Alcove room and it was quite tiny with a small balcony. Not too sure what you can really do with that small balcony. I found it served no purpose. The bed was quite small for a queen size. The sink is positioned outside beside the television, in front of the bed. The shower and toilet was quite tiny too. There weren’t much space to move around. I wouldn’t really recommend tourists with large suitcases.The pool was quite small but cosy. Luckily when we went, there were day beds available. Quite a handful of guests walked away due to the unavailability of day beds.Breakfast was alright. They had a robot egg maker which was cool. The variety at breakfast was average, nothing to shout about.What was upsetting is that upon check out, we realised that they don’t do complimentary parking unless you parked at their lobby (which is a first come first served basis and they had limited lots, maybe around 5?). When we drove towards the hotel, there was a sign that pointed to car park for M Social and we followed it. Turns out that we parked at the apartment that was linked to the hotel. It was misleading as the carpark where we parked had the lift that led us to the hotel directly. We only knew this at check out. We were not told of this during check in.During check out, there was no sign of service recovery as well when we were told that nobody told us this during check in. We wrote in to the hotel on after we checked out but have not received a response yet and it has been about a month already. It shows to me that this hotel doesn’t really care about their guest feedback after all. I will not be staying at this hotel again. For its price and the room and facilities, there are many better hotel options in Singapore with better location as well.","May 5, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

842,"I stayed here for 4 nights in a standard Alcove Cosy Room. If I were not staying on my own, I would have mixed feelings about staying here again, mostly because I so treasure ample bed space and this was a real problem here (and all their rooms have the same “queen” sized bed – I felt it was smaller than a standard queen). We were 2 people of average Asian build and I felt the bed *just* barely fit us. It is a very comfortable bed, but I think they overcompensated with the humongous, billowy pillows. That aside, the room is pretty well designed to make full use of the tiny space. Sound proofing is amazing, shower pressure just right, no bidet though so a bit annoying. No eco-friendly toiletries, so I hope they start thinking about that. Room is dark, with most of the light coming from the astoundingly bright sink mirror lighting (the sole sink being in the bedroom area also a problem when 1 person wants to get ready and the other wants to sleep in). Regarding housekeeping, on my 9th floor room, it was only made up around 2-3pm every day, which seems a bit later than most other hotels. Wifi is fast and fuss-free. Location-wise, it was good for me as I enjoyed the peaceful surroundings and hip F&B outlets along the water. Plus I like walking, so the 20-min walk to Clarke Quay station was very doable. Not for everyone or every occasion though! There are shuttle buses from the hotel to some key spots, but they are infrequent so you have to plan to catch them. Cute robot which delivers things to your room if you need anything. Lap pool is ok, serviceable. Conclusion – if I were traveling on my own on a leisurely trip, I would stay here again.","April 21, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

We didn’t use either ourselves but care across as a novelty.Housekeeping was the one point that let the hotel down . Each day we were there housekeeping didn’t reach our our room until 6/7 pm by which point we were back after a day exploring the city. On all occasions we were up and out of the hotel by 10am at the latest, so were disappointed to come back to the room as we had left it.

Rooms are modern, neat and tidy. I wasn't completely sold on the loft style set up with the bed upstairs, however it was fine. My only one negative which is hardly a negative is that there's almost no waitstaff at breakfast. There's an automated omelette station and self serve coffee / everything. Although fascinating to see robot's taking over human roles and obviously an efficiency in terms of staff wages, however, there's something nice about being greeted with a friendly face as you start the day.

Hotel design is lovely and different from the normal. They offer an opt out of housekeeping where you can choose a welcome drink, late check out or snack which is good for short stays.

861,Excellent hotel for our 4 day stop over in Singapore. Great location on Robertson Quay - excellent for bars and beautiful walk along the quay. Staff very helpful and attention to detail good as I requested a lower floor room which is normally lost on hotel systems but was given one on the 2nd floor. Great pool especially for an evening swim after a hot and humid day sightseeing.,"March 2, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

If you’re looking for ultra luxury then this is not for you if you’re looking for something that’s modern with a great vibe then this is your place.  Great coffee shops and restaurants nearby, little bit far away from the train station. The bus stop is about eight minutes walk  The room service is excellent and a robot gets your food! The rooms of a comfortable, quiet and clean.  Hotel has a gym and a pool, The restaurant kitchen closes very early, before 10 o’clock in the night so you better find a different place to eatOverall, highly recommended great fun","February 26, 2019","15    M Social Singapore

871,"My husband and I would like to leave a commendation for Ramada Singapore for their wonderful services during my wedding dinner banquet on June 16th. We would like to thank the sales manager May Tai and her team, who coordinated the event and had been so helpful to all our queries throughout the whole process. She had been really sincere and tried her best to ensure that everything runs smoothly.Banquet food is undeniably good, backed by thumbs-up from our guests. In particular, salted egg popcorn during the cocktail, braised baby abalone and mushrooms with seasonal greens, Ramada signature herbal chicken, lotus leaf fried rice and cream of avocado with aloe vera and sago is just heavenly. Portions were good and ingredients were of high quality. The Balestier Ballroom is very well furnished, with no pillars and a high headroom. The outdoor solemnisation venue is beautiful with no extra charges. Highly recommended if you want your money's worth for both food and ambience!We had 2 nights' stay in their standard room with bathtub (Bridal suite was available as an option for a night's stay). The room is just fine for the couple to recuperate from a long and tiring day of events. A day use room was provided to us as well, on the actual day. Highly recommended as a wedding venue! 5 stars.","July 5, 2019","16    Ramada by Wyndham Singapore at Zhongshan Park

872,"Stayed here during a conference. The venue was at Marina Bay Sands, not very close - but the hotel was among the recommended by orgs - so the morning shuttles were very useful. Novena MRT station is 1km away, but there is a free shuttle there going until 10pm or so. Can be reached by feet anyway, not a big deal. Going back (downhill) is easier. Good breakfasts - though beware of spicy dishes, sometimes they may surprise you. A small shopping mall with a cheap food court, a supermarket and a few more shoppes is in the same building, requiring only a few lazy steps to reach. Good rooms, though the climate control system is a bit too aggressive for those who's chilled easily, and ventilation lacks in effectiveness (you cannot leave the room with AC on; there is only one card that must be put in the slot in order to have power); when you're back it smells a bit of socks (is dispelled in no time with the AC on).

Max TV volume is too soft to hear anything - even for my teenage son, let alone anyone older! Fridge in room was extremely small and didn't work.

What i didn’t like in this hotel is very unwelcoming front desk team. Trust me this is worst front desk team i have ever seen in a branded property. Please give them proper training about welcoming guests with greetings & smile. Restaurant staff was very good specially the sweet lady on an egg counter. Front office team have a pet line stating come to reception at 02 pm for check in for all guest. I can understand that due to season hotels are running full but they should instruct guests that rooms are not available in a proper way and guide one can use swimming pool or shuttle service to spend their time but they dont care informing all this.Management should seriously look into the training or better front desk team or stay as a guest to feel their cold welcomes.

And everyone was very understanding and was quiet when entering and leaving the room. I was shown great service at reception. I could even store my luggage a good while before check-in and after check-out. And the wifi was free and fast. Everything was also nice and clean.

921,"This was my first time travelling alone, and my first time in a hostel. I decided to go with Adler Hostel because of the great reviews and pictures. I got a Queen bed through Agoda.com and was charged when I booked it. I paid extra for early check-in since I arrived at 7AM, and was brought to my bed. I had minimal sleep during the flight and was pretty exhausted, and since it was my first time at a hostel, was not very aware that it was quiet hours. The staff did not remind me that it was still quiet hours and I wasn't aware of how me unpacking and settling in would affect others.Anyway, the next day the lady across from me gave me a talking to. Apparently she's been staying at the hostel for over half a year now, and has been cross with many of the hostel guests in the past. I didn't want anymore future altercations, so I asked the staff if something could be done. The owner waited for me one evening at the lobby when I came in and assured me that it would not happen again, and offered to switch me to another room with a king bed.I accepted, although I was a bit disappointed because:1) I was there for the hostel experience and the king bed room was basically completely empty. 2) The queen bed room was also females only, and the king bed was mixed, which to me was a disadvantage. 3) The king bed room is on the top floor, and the hostel has no elevator, so it was a trek up everytime.4) The king bed is basically two single beds put together, and it isn't very comfortable to sleep between the cracks.. so really I had less bed space than I did on the queen.Regardless, at least I no longer had to deal with the lady. The rest of the visit was fine. The only thing I wished could be better was the washroom - when I shower, there are a bunch of tiny little termite looking bugs along the window sill which was a bit icky. Otherwise, the whole place was clean and the rooms were air conditioned (not the washroom though).My biggest problem was that when I got home, I noticed that I was charged AGAIN for the my total stay on the day I switched rooms. I had not agreed to paying double to switch to a king bed, and I didn't even want to in the first place. It has now been 1 month since my stay and I have contacted both Agoda.com and Adler hostel multiple times via email, but other than both parties denying that they double charged, and that they would look further into it, I have had no resolution. I called my credit card company to dispute the charge, but now I am stuck with the double charge on my credit card statement. If I don't pay it, my credit score will be hit and I may have to pay interest and penalties.This has overall been more of a frustrating experience for me. I've never had to do a charge back and I've never had so many problems with booking a stay. I don't think I will ever do hostels again.","June 21, 2019","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

I felt they really care about details which surprise you.It is location is very central, next to a beautiful and alive area of cafés and restaurants, and walking distance of everywhere.So, if you're looking for something good value for money in Singapore, and feel confortable in your stay in Singapore, I would definately go for it.","June 2, 2019","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

We were able to leave our luggage and walk around as our flight arrived very early in the morning. We were also able to get discount tickets for Gardens by the Bay from Adler. Just to clarify the sleeping situation, these are bunk beds in a dorm room. It was difficult to tell that by looking at the images. That said, the beds were great, the room was quiet and there was enough space for our stuff in the cubby hole along with a small locking cabinet. Although there is not a great place to cook--and breakfast is not included, there are hawkers markets close by where you can get a meal for $5US.

The hostel staff informed me when I checked in that people were not to talk on their phones or make noise after 10:00 in the sleeping area, so I politely reminded people (one at 11:30pm who was talking in a normal voice on the phone) and they were cooperative. The hostel just needs to make sure when they check people in to tell everyone to be quiet after 10 as there are 16 people in one sleeping area and travelers need their sleep!

936,"I booked at Adler at the very last minute, and it was for New Years.I arrived there quite early (7am) because my flight landed early but I travelled heavy so I decided to head to the hostel first and I knew I wouldn't be able to check in so early.When I arrived, for sure I disturbed the night receptionist, she probably didn't expect someone to check in so early. She told me to come back at 3pm to check in, fine for me but she could had said it in a nicer way and she could also offer to store my bags there until 3pm. I walked around for about 2 hours but I was very sleepy and tired so I headed back to the hostel to wait and take advantage of their wifi.I got my bed at 2pm instead of 3pm, the receptionist (a different one) felt bad that I had to wait for so long, thanks for the gesture. She was very nice and helpful.The queen bed is comfy. The beds are in sort of cubicles which has curtains and give us a lot of privacy. It comes with several shelves to put our belongings and a big locker. For backpackers, you can easily have you backpack with you inside the cubicle because there was a lot space. My queen bed was more than enough for myself but for two, it might be a little tight. The shower rooms and toilets are very clean for a hostel. Shampoo, shower gel and bath towels are provided. The common areas are very nicely decorated and cosy. You don't feel like you're in a hostel when you come in.The location was great too, in Chinatown, just a few minutes walk to Clarke Quay and Marina Bay. Maxwell food court within walking distance. Bus stop right outside the hostel and quiet at night. I was lucky, the other roommates were quiet and respectful towards the other guests. On my last day, the receptionist assisted me to book a shuttle to the airport as my request was very last minute (again). Overall, this is the best experience I've ever had in a hostel, in shared room. It doesn't look and feel like classic hostel and Adler claims to be a luxury hostel which is true as the prices are slightly higher than the other hostels but still cheaper than many other accommodations in Singapore.I would recommend Adler to anyone looking for a nice and comfortable budget accommodation.","January 5, 2019","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

Our flights got changed by the airline, and so we had to book an extra night separately (it was cheaper) and the hostel were very helpful in keeping us in the same pod the whole time, not having to move around even though it was our fault really that we had 2 separate bookings. The bed was so roomy, with a locker for valuables and a little shelf with a charger. We also got water and towels which was a lovely addition (especially after our 11 hour flight!) There’s plenty of space to keep your luggage out of the way, and even though we were worried about there being so many people in the room it never felt crowded, it was very quiet and we barely saw or heard another soul! The WiFi is great and the Air con is a life saver! There’s free coffee, a nice seating area and the location is also amazing, in the heart of china town with loads of eateries and markets around.

940,"Actually I have quite high expectations to my first visit to Adler’s hostel. Especially I saw this is the first luxury hostel in SG. Front Desk is friendly especially Nora.The ambience of lobby is very warm and friendly. Exactly like the photos.The bed is quite comfortable but both of my pillow are quite flat ord. I have to fold it up many times during my sleep to make my head more comfortable. Bed with curtain is very good to let us have our own privacy, but I quite disappointed with the bedsheet. The quality of bedsheet is not so soft and comfortable.it will keep come out when I m moving, suggest maybe can change to more good quality bedsheet to provide guests a good experience .I m staying in Ivory room. Aircon is cold ,and there is enough bathroom for our room. So no need queue up for shower. There are no any fridge at my tower.and the front desk told me if I need to use fridge, I can go another tower which two shops distance with current where I am staying, there got two fridges there. I am wondering that will be very inconvenience for those who staying at the 1st tower if we need to stock up some drinks in fridge. We have to go out.why don’t just leave one fridge in this tower?And currently they are no provide breakfast and a bottle of mineral water anymore,but opposite got 7-11. And beside the hostel got maxwell food court. There got plenty of Singapore famous foods. Superb location, bus stop just in front of the door, mrt station also takes few minutes walking only.Overall this is good stay. But still got abit distance to luxury.

941,"Adler hostel is truly a luxury hostel oasis in the heart of bustling chinatown. From the moment of check-in you get a sense that this is more than just any hostel it’s blurring the lines between hotel & hostel. ROOMSI can honestly say that for me this was the best dorm rooms that i have ever stayed in. So let me explain... i stayed in the premium chamber dorm suite that had a balcony overlooking the nearby famous hindu temple & chinatown. The room was fully air-conditioned had spare luggage storage & even a clothing steamer for the digital nomads out there. My bed was like having my own room, the custom bed has its own curtain, locker, plenty of shelves for extra storage & two lights. It felt super cozy once i was all set up for the night. BATHROOMSTruly in terms of hostels these bathrooms would be classed as luxury. Super high quality finish with luxury shampoo & soap provided. Showers are super strong, hot & had plenty of space to put all your things. COMMON AREASThey have two common rooms as they have two buildings within a few meters of each other. Elegantly furnished with eclectic furniture from around the world. A widescreen tv, mac computer & espresso machine are free for you to use. The comfy sofa next to reception is a great place to unwind after a hard day exploring. SERVICES The staff at reception where there to help & answer all my questions / needs 24/7. They have luggage storage, laundry, espresso machine, purified water. The coffee shop located in the second building has a great selection of coffee, iced drinks & food.LOCATIONIts in the heart of chinatown in the downtown area of Singapore. The location is perfect for access to the metro & also for all the amazing restaurants & nightlife in nearby chinatown. I rented an electric pedestrian scooter to help me get around the city much quicker & i recommend to do the same.. ","November 8, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

944,"My sister and I had stayed 4 nights at Adler. It was overall an awesome experience! The pods were sturdy, mattresses were fine, we were able to sleep through the night pretty well. What I love the most was that the pods were private enough (thick curtains with hooks on both ends to hold them, thick walls) to give us a sense of safety despite sharing the room with other people. The decor is so chic. The receptionist who worked the night shift were also very friendly. This will be the default choice for us in Singapore.","October 18, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

957,"The location is as good as it can be: you have access to all of Singapore's fabulous Chinatown right outside the door, and only a few minutes walk to the bay marina. The Adler is located on South Bridge road, which passes through some of the most beautiful parts of the city and ends in the vicinity of Little India. The renown hindu ""holy cow temple"" is just opposite the Adler, and shawm music wakes you up in the morning.The property is cosy and shared spaces are big, but quite worn out and need more attention and better cleaning. A huge plus, though, for the wonderful shower cream which makes you happy if you like oriental scents. There's complimentary coffee and tea but no breakfast served which is bad. They would much increase the positive experience of the place by just serving kaya butter toast and eggs with the coffee, a local tradition. ","July 12, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

959,This is one of the nicest hostel we have stayed in on our round the world trip. LocationThe hostel is situated right in the city centre. China town is across the road and is very clean and doesn’t smell from all the food etc like some other China towns I have been to in the passed. There is also a 7/11 located on the street too. Along with many restaurants and bars within 2 walking distance from the hostel. China point mall is a 3 minute walk from the hostel which has everything in it. MRTYou also have China town MRT station across the road which is on a great line for getting around Singapore. Use the directions on the ‘Adler Hostel’ page on hostelworld for getting from the airport to the hostel it costs less than £2 and it’s honestly so easy trust me. Marina bay is around 10 mins on the MRT or 20-30 minute walk. Use the MRT as it’s soooo unbelievable cheep use. Get a Flash card thing at any station for S$12 and you get S$7 credit to use on the MRT and you top it up. Your travel will be so much easier as you can just tag on and off instead of buy tickets all the time. It’s like London’s oysters card. Any money you have on it can take off when you leave Singapore. StaffAll the staff are so nice and friendly and always there too help you in anywhere you want to go. There are many young staff who work there but there is a lady which works there who was so nice and always so welcoming and interested in our trip and making us laugh. DormThe dorm was great and very clean. They have good quality curtains and very comfy beds. You have a good size locker in the wall next your bed which is great. Nice cosy duvet cover with two pillows too. The showers are hot and powerful and clean. The dorm has good aircon too. HostelThe common type of area is very nice and has comfy couches and chairs. They have a iMac computer which you can use if you need to surf the internet or print stuff out. You can also wash and dry you clothes here as they have there own machines I the 1st floor. There is also a water machine on the second floor next to the washer and dryers to fill your water bottle up. It’s also very secure in a safe location and has 24h staff. PriceFor all the people who are traveling and find the price a bit expensive honestly just pay it and be in the city centre where you can jump on the MRT or walk to all the sights and be in the middle of everything going on. This is probably the best places I have stayed on my whole trip. I would definitely come back. Well worth the money. ThanksAdler Hostel. ,"May 24, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

I appreciate the jet washer in the toilet also because it’s hard to find in SG- -Some of the minor cons are the blanket is not wide enough for 2, we have to sleep stuck together. Sometimes the water filter is empty so we cant get free water. On the last day, a male worker came into our room without warning :( good thing we’re all already properly clothed by then.

964,"Good branding is everything! In my travel-magazin on the plain to Singapore I did reed an article about these new boutique-hostels- the Adler Hostel was featured in there as well. I was intrigued- nice design, more comfort, space and privacy in a modern setting, what's not to like. Booked.My first impression on arrival, yes everything what you saw previously on the website is there. But in detail it's a different story: The furniture in the lobby is kinda cheap and some stuff is worn down, you can tell that it is more of a setup for a good photo shoot then actual quality. Besides the fancy looks, the rest of the building is more functional. Same goes for the dorm. You get what you paid for, but just that and not more. Its still a hostel, luggage all over the place, bathroom cleanliness depends on the residents and the window that was promised in the room... it is more a hole in the wall. This sounds pretty bad, but that's not the goal of my review. It is just that you can adjust the expectations. There is a lot of good to report. Comfortable beds, good towels and soap is provided, free coffee and stable in-room internet. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well. It is a really good hostel with a nice design- but it's a hostel non the less.","March 9, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

966,"The location is really great - public transport stops are near, you can walk to many sightseeing around. This hostel provides free walking tours on certain days (in Chinatown and Little India), as well they have cheap tickets to Marina Sand bay and other places. The hostel interior really inspiring, fast free wi-fi everywhere. No breakfast included but you can buy coffee from a machine or just go across the street to ""7eleven"" and buy everything you need. They provide towel and in a bathroom, you can find shampoo and shower gel. I stayed in this hostel only 1 night in ""Vault room"". It's 6-bed female dorm room without a window on the first floor that has separate WC and shower room. However, when I arrived first of all in their system was shown that I booked a bed in mixed dormitory I explained and ask to check again. They changed to a room I booked. Like a room is without a window you feel a bit humid inside, even if there is a airco. You don't have too much space in the room as well if you stay in the bed that facing the wall with stairs to other rooms (for example bed no 2) you can hear quite loud sounds of the steps. I assume only people who use Vault room should use the toilet and bathroom but also people from other rooms come there (and those who stays in the lobby). You get 2 different pillows, warm blanket, my towel was with a big big hole but clean. Everything looks clean but for such price, I think it should be maintained better especially bathroom. The staff very helpful and friendly. If I would need to stay in that area again, I would search for a cheaper place, coz without unique interior I think the rest is like in most of the hostels.","January 24, 2018","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

967,"I stayed her for a few days whilst in Singapore. It’s location is very convenient, right next to China Town. The MTR is about 10 minutes walk away. The rooms are spacious and the bunk beds are three storeys high. If you have a preference for the bottom bunk and dislike climbing up and down, make sure you let them know at the time of booking. Each bed is self contained. It has a black out curtain giving you complete privacy, you own small lockable cupboard at the end of the bed, shelves, two lamps and two electrical sockets. It’s a really nice setup. The mattress is firm, just how I like it. The o lot downside is that the mattress gets a bit hot due to the waterproof type top layer meaning it does not breath as well. The showers and toilets are clean and the common areas on the group floor has plenty of chairs and sofas to relax on. The breakfast is very basic, some cereal and toast. However this is included in the price and since you’re right next to China Town with all the hawker food stands, it is very cheap to go out for breakfast. I was personally not able to login to the WiFi but I had my own internet with my phone provider so it was not an issue. I know if I really needed the WiFi, the staff would have assisted. The aircon the room is strong and keeps things cools as well as the air fresh. Some have complained on here about the room being freezing cold. It isn’t! It is fine. It is a mixed dorm. It is much easier to put on more clothes if you are cold than to strip off which would not be appropriate. Plus, there are blankets. The main downside of the place is that the showers are not very hot, just luke warm. There is also no air con in the bathrooms or hallways so it is very humid and stuffy outside your room. However, this isn’t such a bad thing and it is good for the environment. Perhaps fans might be a good compromise. All in all, a very good place. Not as good as the hostels I stayed in whilst in Japan but they do set a very high bar. I have yet to stay a hostels anywhere in the world to the standard of Japan. A solid four out of five for this place. ","November 30, 2017","17    Adler Hostel & Coffee Bar

Our first stay was better than the second. It was located three doors away from the main reception. I think it was their new building. During our second stay, I asked for possible transfer of rooms but the reception girl said they were full and cannot accomodate requests (Grand Prix weekend).Old (above main reception): windowless; New: with windows Old: Pillows are thin; New: Pillows are big and soft.Old: Doors of bathroom have spaces. New: Doors can completely close.Comforters and towels were good for both. Aircon and water okay. But they dont change towels and sheets everyday (maybe only after guests check-out).Breakfast was served in the new bldg so if you are staying at the old one, you got to go out of the street and walk three doors more. Breakfast was simple; cereals, bread and jam, scrambled eggs, and coffee. That's it. No fruits, no sausage, no juice, as seen in previous pics. Maybe they changed menu.I asked for assistance in wifi with the reception guy, but he prioritized the guests checking-in who came AFTER me. I ended up on my own.But I commend the reception girl who booked our USS tickets. Very fast and friendly.:)Check-in was strictly 3pm.

But what impressed me the most was your staff whose namee I can only see as Ali who was in a black suit who was controlling the hotel drop off point. While I was waiting for a taxi with my wife and kids, i was approached by Ali who asked if we need a taxi. And There was this smal child was playing and he just dashed across the road without any adults and he managed to grab and hold his hand and help the child to his parents who was busy taking picture at your fountain. The place was really crowded and he was alert enough to stop the kid from getting injured by any oncoming traffic. You should commend him because the kid would be injured if he did not grabbed the kid on time from dashing the road.","July 5, 2019","18    PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road

Staff were helpful and courteous, rooms spacious and clean, the pool and gym were nice areas to relax. Unfortunately there are major building works next door and the noise outside is constant from 7am till 9pm. The renovation work being done inside was well managed and didn't affect guests at all. Some of the nicer perks in a hotel of this price are missing, such as a snack bar or free local calls.

When I check in hotel, there was very long que for checking in and only 3 person is on seat for check in. It took around 1.5 hour for checkin process. And secondly They don't know how to talk to customer. They only cheat and want to make money. There is small stain on bed sheet. They told that stain is not going after washing and they had tried all the things on stain. So we have to pay its price i.e. 116 SGD (6150.00 RS.). Then we told them that it is easily washable. They told us to clean it ourself and return. When we clean it, stain goes easily. They had not properly clean it. I told them that I have never seen this type of hotel who charge for bedsheet. Infact they have not even clean it. I didn't expect this type of cheating from 4 star hotel. I think that they even don't deserve a single star.","June 25, 2019","18    PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road

I got some flight problem, they are willing to adjust the booking time, it's really nice of them. The communication went well although there are several staffs in charge. Overall, the room is spacious and with local-styled decoration. With Chinese background, I am pretty familiar with the little delights and cultural symbols in room deco, and I think these are pretty fun and attractive with unique style, especially for western visitors.”","July 1, 2019","19    Hotel Nostalgia

1031,"Hotel Nostalgia is a converted shophouse furnished in the older European style favoured in pre-war Singapore. The staff are welcoming and speak English as well as Chinese. Super location in Tiong Bahru with an excellent seafood restaurant next door, bus stop just outside the hotel, and the famous Tiong Bahru Market just round the corner. Tiong Bahru market is a hawker centre with all kinds of delectable Asian specialities and fresh fruit juices. Breakfast was included and tasty. The hotel has a small rooftop pool with loungers and a dip in the pool makes for a nice end to the day! Good deals on happy hour at the bar, and on-site restaurant which mainly does Western food. By American standards, rooms can seem small. If you are a couple or family, it's a good idea to let them know that you would like a larger room. You pay a small deposit at the start of your stay (this is common in most Singapore hotels). You can walk to Tiong Bahru MRT (subway/metro) in 15 minutes and this MRT also has a shopping centre, pharmacy and some cafes. Outram MRT is a similar distance.Tiong Bahru is an historic district and an up and coming 'hipster' destination. It's a chance to see a part of Singapore which happily combines its history (as one of Singapore's first public housing estates) and Singapore cool. I would love to come back to this hotel","June 5, 2019","19    Hotel Nostalgia

1032,"My husband and I have always enjoyed a weekend getaway at Hotel Nostalgia because of its location, which is literally 5 mins away from home. After a couple of stays, there was a particular morning that I called front desk requesting for a late check out. The front desk Staff, a female, acknowledged my request. When I wanted to confirm the late check out, she responded ""you've stayed here before right?"". This was sarcasm that was not necessary but we let it slip. Moving on, just this previous afternoon, a staff, perhaps manager named Jeffrey had checked us in with the worst attitude I've ever experienced from a front desk staff. My husband and I felt really hurt and discriminated perhaps because we are singaporean Indians and were judged as a couple checkin in for fun. Jeffrey asked us for our Identity documents, which is a normal protocol but the manner in which he asked for it was too obvious to overlook. We still let it slip because we just wanted to have a good weekend. Right after he verified our identity cards and gave us a form to sign, he outright accused us of smoking in the room the previous time we checked in because he said the housekeeper had smelt it. I assured him that we have never done that because we've been checking in there since last year and we are well aware of the no-smoking policy. Despite me trying to explain to him, he brushed me off with a very cold shoulder and insisted that we will be fined if it happens again. At this point I told him to watch his tone because it was disgusting and rude, the way we were being treated. I will never go back here and I hope the staff can improve on how they speak to their customers in the future.","June 1, 2019","19    Hotel Nostalgia

There were many small restaurants close by but we really wanted to go into the central Chinatown market area. This was quite some distance away - around a 25 minute walk. We had thought we would be closer. The pipes were really noisy which was probably to be expected for an old style hotel. A little disturbing though.

1037,"We arrived after midnight, the check-in host was fantastic and we got offered 15% vouchers. We did not use the vouchers, the food market is close (across the road) and it is much cheaper.The hotel cleanliness was really good, the rooms were nice and tidy. I was disappointed to find we had a small room with a inside building view and that was really disappointing, the room felt dark and shutter wood slats that are faced so not enough light can come in.Let put it this way I wouldn’t want to stay again if I get a small “deluxe” room. It makes me wonder what a Standard room would look like?!The bar/ staff they give you a smile and turn on the fans for only people who order from the bar, not for people who want to just sit and relax outside in the bar area.Happy to say they allow drinks from the seven eleven shop next door.The old guy I believe known as Jeffery made us feel unwelcome he is absolutely rude, no smile, welcome or any sort of acknowledgement, he really is rude and does need some skills in Customer Service.The hotel seems fine otherwise, but be aware you cannot also leave a room card in the electricity slot because Jeffery will get angry like he did with us. I have to give two stars because of the room view & size, along with arrogant Jefferey and not putting the fans on constantly only when people order.I noticed the staff will really attend to you when you order from them.

1076,"First impression on arrival is professionalism, friendliness and courtesy of the staff. Rooms and bathrooms are squeaky-clean but small. As a guide to prospective guests, our superior room had a double bed with one side pressed against the wall and a narrow walkway the width of a bedside table on the other. There was little room for cases. If you are the sort of traveler who feels the need to spread out, this could be a consideration. For us, it was adequate. All appointments were first-class: excellent toiletries, toothbrushes, and facial tissues (often neglected by hotels). There is a room safe and security, in general, seems good.The area is excellent - a nice part of town with several good restaurants and just across the road from the Tiong Bahru food centre (a very clean, orderly hawker centre with an enormous choice of excellent food).If, as we do, you like to use public transport, the Singapore transport card is so convenient and there is a bus stop to town almost outside the hotel.","November 24, 2018","19    Hotel Nostalgia

Fantastic local Hawkers food centre around the corner . All the staff were fantastic , Zul in the bar was very helpful and will do his best to answer any questions you have about the area.

1101,"I stayed here for 4 nights and found it to be perfectly located right on top of the Bencoolen railway station and with a variety of restaurants to choose from. As long as you have the railway line handy it doesn't really matter where you choose to stay in Singapore and there are plenty of restaurants & shopping centres all over the place. The hotel is non-descript from the front but it's easy to spot from the street. You don't come here to stay in a large luxurious suite but rather for a clean & functional room suitable to sleep and shower when you're not sightseeing. We stayed in a superior double room and it was very tight with only minimal room to walk around the bed and no space for luggage. The pictures online are not an accurate reflection of the room size so if you are a larger person or have a few pieces of luggage you will struggle in this room. This being said, apart from the room size the room was very clean and tidy with daily service. Staff were very courteous and responded to requests quickly. If you purchased breakfast included this is served in a restaurant next door and your usual buffet. We didn't and had a starbucks around the corner and many local breakfast outlets at very reasonable prices.

We had to move a bed to make space available for our 2 luggage. It will be difficult for 2 people to move freely. We didnt take the breakfast of the hotel as it was expensive.In summary, you will feel the price of the hotel do not justify its worth. However, due to its location and sleep quality, this hotel can be considered average.","March 24, 2019","20    V Hotel Bencoolen

1142,From the beginning this hotel was unimpressive. We had booked a room for four (myself and our two sons.. 11 & 10) yet they were only giving us 3 beds in our room... no sofa bed just a queen and a single. After I repeatedly asked where my second child would sleep they reluctantly wheeled in another single bed. The room was grotty and dated and stank like someone had spilled bleach on the floor. The lights by the bed were bent and nearly electrocuted my husband when we went to find the switch to turn it off... instead he blew a fuse. No apology when we informed reception. To turn out the lights you have to take the card out of the wall ... leaving no active light switch in the bathroom (or anywhere) if you need to use it during the night. Not ideal with children. They woke us and we had to use light from our phone.The breakfast room was small cramped and over crowded... food variety was dismal hardly any fruit variety.. not natural yogurt... coffee machine made cold coffee... one morning croissants were stale and hard as rocks...no one shows you to a table you just grab whatever you can. Our room was across the road on the quieter side... with a broken lift and it stank so bad of bleach in the corridor it was horrible.The location was fantastic but there was a nicer looking hotel two doors down that I wish we had booked instead. The man who cleaned our room everyday was lovely and friendly but I do not recommend this hotel.. the best part was when we left (and still no one helped us with our bags) !,"July 7, 2019","21    Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospita...

But then again it call comes down to speed of service and keeping one's promise if you have already committed to it. We checked in and specifically stated we wanted a double bed instead of twin bed, the staff apologised and said they only had twin bed but they will join the bed for us. We agreed to it and went out for a walk. 6 hours later, well, nothing was done yet so we called housekeeping AND front desk because no one attended to us for about a good 1 hour. Funnily they did not have a double bed quilt and placed the single bed quilt horizontally across the bed.The other down side of it is the stench of chlorine the moment we walk into the building across the lobby, where our room is. We asked one of the staff about it but he said ""really? I think we've gotten used to it"".

Another staff Jason, do not know the meaning of being polite to customers as instead of saying,"" excusing me, when walking, he said Hello and show hand sign to move away so rudely"" Not sure which school of hospitality they went to.Anyway, when we checked out the staff handled us was good, he name was Indra and he was very pleasant. The hotel is good, comfortable room, clean bathroom and located strategically as it is near to Little India and Rochor MRT about 3 min walk. However if the hotel don't hire proper staff, then people might just go else where.","June 8, 2019","21    Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospita...

1182,"I had occasion to vist the Village Hotel Abert Court last year whilst on a family trip to Singapore. It was during an afternoon's exploration of the surrounds in Little India that I discovered and was drawn to the richly restored style and setting of this charmingly nestled cobbled street, boutique hotel. Venturing inside did not dissapoint - the ambiance and serenity that meets you is at once welcoming and it is hard to believe that you are surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the district vicinity. Even more impressive for me was the impeccable service I received from the GM who happened to be at the front desk as I was making my enquiries about a future hotel stay in Singaore. He took the time to show us around the premises and give us a little history of the archtecture and surrounds, even stopping to pick up a piece of paper off the floor as we were walking; this may seem insignificant but spoke volumes to me about the pride and care he took in the hotel. We will be travelling to Singapore in the near future and will definitely be booking to stay at the Village Hotel Albert Court.","May 8, 2019","21    Village Hotel Albert Court by Far East Hospita...

1186,"I booked Village Hotel Bugis, but was only told upon arrival that the room with double bed has some faulty part and cannot be used. Was offered to transfer to Village Hotel Albert Court at Little India with the promise of an upgrade to club suite. We were left with no choice since it was already 2+pm and we had a dinner to get to in the evening at Bugis (which is why I booked Bugis!!) - but alas, we were moved to Little India. Staff were curt and unfriendly, at the recep the lady didn't even look at me when I asked her questions. No greeting, welcome, just asked for my IC and proceeded to do check-in. No smiles, nothing. It was the worse hotel experience I had. Club suite REEKED of chlorine, reminded me of public pools. Room was an ok size but walls were thin and throughout the night and day we heard doors slamming, people talking outside our rooms. It was also on level 2 and we could hear vehicles and noises from ground floor even though windows were closed. Also when I made my booking on Booking.com for Village Hotel bugis, i informed them it is my bf's birthday and they said they will give complimentary chocolates. But there was totally none. Will never recommend this hotel to anyone, not even if it was $10 a night. Also, as a result of the transfer, we had to spend additional $ to cab to and fro our dinner place at Bugis, which would have been a 4min walk if we had remained at the bugis hotel. Would have been fine if the 'upgrade' was worth it, but it wasn't. Ruined the birthday experience I had planned for my partner.

Room rates are considerably reasonable compared to other properties in the same class along the shopping belt but the rooms are clean, well kept and in good shape. Staff are wonderful right from the doorman at arrival to check in and check out. They offered great direction when asked and made special effort to show us short cuts to reduce walking ourdoors uneccessarily.The hotel is surrounded by lots of eateries in the neighbouring Cuppage Plaza, with 7eleven and several 24 hour outlets within a 3 minute walk. The Centrepoint Shopping Centre is a 5 minute walk away and 95% of the trip is through a sheltered footpath, which is great! Just across this mall is the Somerset MRT station for easy access to the island-wide train lines.I highly recommend this property for those who are looking at staying in the Orchard area.

1199," This hotel is located in a good location however I feel it’s outdated they need to modernize and refurbish their rooms and bathrooms they remind me the hotels of 1980s.  Other than that I had a credit balance with this hotel ie. Money was taken out of my account a year before on which they agreed to let me use their facilities but they let me down as they couldn’t refund me back. The spa they claim that is downstairs isn’t even owned by hotel hence I couldn’t even use my extra credit of 295 Dollars. I requested them if I could use their car service to take me to excursions etc and amount to be deducted from my credit balance they simply refused. I was very disgusted and disappointed. I asked for the manager he too couldn’t assist me in anything and refused completely to even give me a refund since I couldn’t use any of their facilities they kept forcing me to buy food. Being an IHG member, I had already purchased the club executive lounge package to which I would use their lounge and dine during late afternoon and evening snacks and cocktails ie. Pizzas, sandwiches, little pastries, biscuits , tea , coffee etc which normally fills one up. Even after trying to explain to them to allow me to use my money for their other facilities they wouldn’t agree in the end I had no choice but to order food from the Indian restaurant. He was very corporative and helpful we ordered the food and picked it up in the evening.  Their manager is pathetic and I feel he needs to present himself better to his customers even the way he dresses and talks isn’t like professional managers at all. Otherwise I would rate this place an average place yes if your an IHG member you do get to access their club executive lounge as well as breakfast is setup totally different but same buffet for IHG members only with good service totally in a different hall.  They are better holiday hotels with fair prices on clarke quay and other side next time I would definitely opt for those I will never come here again !

The mini bar is empty so you can restock it yourself, which is better as the hotel drinks are more expensive. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The breakfast had a decent selection and variety.

1204,"This is a really good hotel at the very centre of Singapore and is a great place to stay for lots of reasons. I stayed in an executive room, which gave me access to the lounge for breakfast. The room was clean, comfortable, well equipped and everything worked as it should, the shower was perfect with instant hot water on demand and the beds were super comfortable.Breakfast in the executive lounge catered for almost all tastes and was of consistently high quality, the staff were polite and helpful at all times. I had room service on two occasions and the food was also of a very good standard.Checking in and out was fast and efficient and the staff were always pleasant and very professional during my stay. The hotel is located just off Orchard Road for those of you who are into shopping and is opposite Cuppage Road which has a very nice selection of restaurants and bars all in easy walking distance.All in all a really nice place to stay and if you are planning to visit Singapore for business or pleasure, I would highly recommend staying at the Orchard City Centre, you will not be disappointed.","June 16, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre

1205,"Being here with family booked 2 club rooms with 2 double bed each. The experience here was not at all satisfying. We traveled with an infant and have already conveyed to hotel for an early check-in. When we reached hotel the staff offered us a lower category room for early check-in and told we can not change rooms and have to stay in lower category room for the complete period but when we told ""no we want our booked rooms"" he said to wait till 2 PM for check-in. After calling our travel agent and a long discussion they agreed to change our rooms to booked rooms on the next day if we take lower category room today or asked us to pay SGD 100 per room for getting our rooms on the same day itself. The Double Bed Room is a marketing gimmick as the beds are smaller than the queen size beds and also the club facilities provided are unusable if you are there as a tourist as during the period of free snacks and drinks you are usually out for some adventure. The front desk staff is less cooperative and lack basic hospitality. Would suggest to book other hotel whcih gives king size bed with extra bed.","June 14, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre

1216,"This is a very nice hotel, and overall I'd highly recommend it. The location is great, food is outstanding, and all of the staff were friendly, helpful, polite, and a real pleasure to deal with. The pool and exercise room are really nice. My only complaints were these: 1. The hotel room (#514) had a strong musty, mildewy smell. I know that's more common in a tropical climate, but I've stayed in two other Singapore hotels (including a much cheaper one on this same trip) that didn't have that problem. 2. The alarm clock in the room was terrible! First time I've ever met a clock I couldn't figure out how to use. And when it went off (earlier than desired) it sounded like a fire alarm--very loud and obnoxious. Bad way to start the day! I had to unplug it.3. Noise issues. The family next door with young kids would be yelling in the hallways up to midnight, every single night, though I can't necessarily blame the hotel for that. (Positive: The walls were very soundproof. I didn't hear any noise coming from the rooms on either side.) A colleague was on the third floor. He said he had to listen to the music from wedding receptions or other parties downstairs until 3:00 a.m. So he didn't sleep much.Having said those things, I still have to rate the hotel highly, and I'd be willing to stay there again. Hopefully not all rooms smell like 514 did.","May 24, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre

Our room was small but spotlessly clean and comfortable with good toiletries. Breakfast is excellent. Staff, efficient, friendly and welcoming. We loved Singapore and hope to return for longer. If so, we would definitely stay here again.","July 10, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

1245,"This hotel is very conveniently located. Clean, efficient staff and very comfortable beds. The only critique I can offer is that the room we had was very small, but we managed to place both suitcases on elevated furniture...one on the desk and the other on the suitcase stool. We can't criticise anything else as we just loved both of our stays and will stay there again in the future. The included breakfast was diverse covering a wide range of cuisine. If you breakfast later it is a little hard to find somewhere to sit and eat so we chose earlier times. It's a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay where we found THE VERY BEST BALINESE RESTAURANT. We ate there three times. The food tasted just like Rudi's mother's Indonesian dishes. Yummy. ","July 2, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

Even though we arrived before 10am in the morning we were given our room straight away which was great as we could freshen up and then get on with our day. Great swimming pool on the rooftop with two jacuzzis, gym and large terrace area with sunbeds and plenty of towels. No bar though :( but vending machines with cold drinks/snacks. There was plenty of choice for breakfast to suit everyone. The bar/eating area is lovely, half outside/half inside with a lovely breeze blowing through all the time.

1251,If your looking for a hotel within a 3 minute walk to the bars and restaurants in Clarke Quay at a reasonable cost then you will be happy with the Holiday Inn Express. It's not a four star in my books but more of a hotel you would stay at near the airport offering a fairly basic room but comfortable. Its a bit of rabbit warren but once you've worked out the corridors and lifts it's not to bad. The staff are helpful and it is close to most amenities. As with most hotels in Singapore there is a 7 eleven with meters of the hotel. A good hotel for a night or two's stopover.

1253,My partner and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express recently and found the location of the hotel great. Behind the hotel was the river and there was a bridge across to quite a few bars and restaurants. We paid just below RM500 per night or just under £100 per night which was not too bad. It was close enough to central and amenities and rooms were acceptable. Pillows were a bit soft. There was a small gym at the rooftop and a lap pool. I used the gym which was adequate but lacking in the weights and dumbbells section. Overall the experience was good given that hotels near Orchard Road were closer to the RM800 range pernight.,"June 15, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

It is clean, comfortable and well located. To be fair the rooms are on the smallish side but are very functional and everything works well. The included breakfast is more than adequate to satisfy most people. Sure, there are probably other hotels that offer more services and dining options - but if you are happy to save a few dollars and forego a few of the luxuries you will be more than comfortable here.

Staff were very friendly and happy to help. Breakfast was good and 7-elevens are nearby to stock up the fridge! Location is awesome and mrt stops are in a 5-10 min walk away.

The Rooms are small but well organised and really cleanHere’s what I don’t like: I only have one issue 1. The price of the beer is just ridiculous - $12 at happy hour is just not on.

1265,This hotel was very clean and well organised. Gorgeous pool and rooftop views. The Rooms are smallish but have everything you need including a kettle a small fridge and iron. I liked it here we walked to the bus stops and it is walking distance to many restaurants and bars. The breakfast was the usual buffet. Breakfast staff member Kim was a wealth of knowledge and her customer service brilliant. Km deserves a customer service award. She made sure I had Gluten Free bead each morning and she was welcoming and happy nothing was too much trouble for her even when it was extremely busy. If I had anything negative it would be that this hotel doesn’t have a chef/cook in the evening so anything ordered is pre packaged. Not good for my special dietary needs. There is a cafe in the hotel and it supplies gf bread but doesn’t make gf sandwiches. But does have cake. I would stay here again. ,"May 20, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

I got a message that my MRI had been moved forward right when I was having my break in Singapore, consequently I had to cancel the trip. Singapore Airlines were brilliant and refunded all of my airfare without question or hassle. This hotel on the other hand, has given me the run around beyond belief!!I called the hotel reservations line and the lady there was brilliant, she actually suggested that since this was a medical issue she would get approval to refund my total charges.....she put me on hold. A gentleman by the name of Shafiq came on the line, had to explain my situation all over a again to him. he said he would send me an email to confirm the conversation and the next steps......you guessed it...NOTHING in the last few days.

Lots of dining choices near either station and 7/11 round the corner.

It’s hooked up to 4G for you to use out and about, used constantly for maps and MRT times while we were out and it allowed for free calls in lots of destinations.Loved the rooftop, the pool was great but could almost do with the jacuzzi being a little warmer as felt too cold after the heat of the sun.

Unfortunately, the door isn’t made to keep sound out, we were woken about 6 times throughout the early hours by groups of people talking normally outside as they walked passed. Our friends in another room had the same experience. Very frustrating as we had an early flight and I’d say not very practical if you’re on a business trip. Also, breakfast buffet was very disappointing. Very limited selection for westerners. In terms of hot savoury, they only had eggs, tiny sausages, and a bowl of corned beef that looked like dog food.

The public areas were comfortable, there was free access to Computer terminals and Internet so that we were able to check into flights and print boarding passes. The hotel staff were all friendly and very helpful. We would use this hotel again.","April 26, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

Hotel was beautiful with friendly staff, cant fault their service at all! even allowed to have a late 2pm check out.The room were cosy and clean, however I recommend avoiding any rooms near the lifts and some guests don't have the courtesy of being quiet.The only down side for me is the awkward distance to both chinatownMRT or Clark QuayMRT. If you prefer the area and have a little more budget for accomodation, i would recommend swissotel merchant court as it is connected to the MRT station.","April 24, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

The included breakfast was handy but not much choice for vegetarians and a bit more variety would have been welcome. There were queues for the coffee machine, but good local cafes about 10-15 minutes walk away. The best thing about the hotel is Kim who was working the breakfast shift.

1287,"A very safe bet in Singapore. No hanging gardens of Babylon here, but still has pleasant outside spaces and a rooftop pool with a view. It’s not opulent, but it’s very slick and stylish. The inclusions are very good, including breakfast. The bar meals are simple but tasty, and the bakery / coffee shop is spot on. Rooms are terrific. Small, because it’s Singapore! But very effective and tastefully set up. Great location too. Very handy. For all of this you pay in the mid-lower mid range. It’s a busy place, and I can’t find anything to moan about here. It’s a very safe bet. Highly recommended and my go-to choice in Singapore. If you can afford a night in Marina Bay, please do! It’s amazing.

1293,"Stayed her for a business trip. Enough has been said about the size of the rooms. They are very small but you can put up with them. The bathroom had one of those soap/shampoo dispenser on the wall. Don’t like the idea of washing hair and body with the same stuff. Bring your own. The big thing for me was dinner choices whilst eating on your own. Clarke quay is a very lively place with heaps of places to eat. Whilst I did it once, eating out by yourself in such a lively area is a bit uncomfortable. Unfortunately, eating at the hotel isn’t that much better. You have to go down to the bar and order from a limited menu. Did this twice and had Butter Chicken and Singapore Chicken Rice. Should get over my feeling of being uncomfortable about eating on my own and went out more. Ok but not great. ","April 13, 2019","23    Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay

1296,"I stayed at the Dorsett for 3 nights in early July, business trip. The hotel is fine for the price bracket - the pool is very nice, although there could be a few more amenities and protection from the view and noise of traffic; the restaurant to be avoided. The hotel is on the edge of Chinatown - not the sterile Singapore I had expected, but rather a messy, vibrant and trendy network of streets and alleyways, with some delicious food. But the best thing by far was the hotel staff, who are the friendliest and most helpful I have ever come across. On arrival, I was allowed to check in and given a room hours before the due time; after a long o/n flight from London that was wonderful. During my stay, I found helpful and friendly advice whenever required. And on the day I left, I was allowed to check out two hours later, and then given that I had to work and my flight was late, I was offered the staff office for 3 hours. So I could work and relax before the next 13hr flight to Australia. The star that day was Yadi, who made it all easy and fun.

1301,Arrived after a late night flight and the check-in process was extremely smooth and friendly even for the early hours of the morning. My partner and I were celebrating a special occasion and the staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect for those who don't want the hustle and bustle of Orchard but still want the convenience of easy MRT access to Santosa & Marina Bay. The proximity to local hawkers/ Chinatown made the trip all that more authentic.Working in the Hospitality industry myself & having been to Singapore many times I would have no hesitation recommending Dorsett to my friends and family for their future travel. Please commend the whole team for an overall amazing experience. Looking forward to staying here again. - Yohan,"June 26, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1302,"So my sister made the booking for me under her Agoda account. I came to the front desk and showed the booking confirmation and passport. The front-desk staff requested that I or my sister must contact Agoda to confirm my name in the booking request. Ok, so my sister messaged Agoda under the booking reference section on Agoda website. I showed that to the front-desk (I had to queue again behind other guests who came after me) but they said a web message is not acceptable and demanded my sister directly call Agoda. Ok, so I had to step aside again to call my sister, she called Agoda and after several attempts Agoda picked up the phone and did sort it out, said that they will send an email to the hotel immediately. I asked the front-desk, but was instructed to wait until further notice. After another 25 minutes I could not stand anymore and go ask them again, they told me they received the email from Agoda just now, but when I insisted to see the email receiving time, it was actually 20 minutes ago. I came to the hotel at 1.30 pm. And after all this bureaucratic front-desk process of Dorsett, I checked in to my room at 2.45 pm. That's 1h and 15 minutes I will never get back and a lot of nuisances. So much for a 4-star hotel.I don't know whether this is merely bad process, or differentiated treatments for 3rd-party booking guests and walk-in guests.

Omelettes cooked to order.We were within walking distance of China Town which is lovely and provides numerous places to eat and shop in the evening ( we didn't see it in daytime).Also on the doorstep of the hotel were wine bars and restaurants - much cheaper than hotel dining.We used the pool in the afternoon which was perfect after a busy day rushing around.Happy hour at the bar was also a great start to the evening.A brilliant trip enhanced by May who extended our checkout time to fit in with our next stop - this allowed for more sightseeing.We would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again.","April 29, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1321,"We booked this hotel based on the reviews on travel websites but the room that was given to us didn't reflect the good reviews we had read at all. The room smelled really bad upon entering and I had to leave air con running constantly to keep it bearable. The carpet had pretty bad stains all over the room and I was scared to walk around bare feet. The wallpaper had some old glue residue (or some kind of repair, see pictures) and was very old and showed its age. The shower cubicle had mould on rubber sealing and floor tiles, again, I couldn't use the shower bare feet. The toilet paper holder was rusted badly and broken. The management was informed and they were swift to come up to inspect the room. They agreed that the room was not fit for purpose, but they were still unable to offer any compensation that was acceptable considering the state of the room and what I had paid for it. They did fix the toilet paper holder and clean the mould etc. but too little too late. This hotel was probably very good in the past but it seems not enough is being done in terms of maintenance. I was able to find better hotel around Clarke Quays area for less money that I paid for this hotel, avoid at all costs and go some where else if possible. The location is good as the hotel is right next to the MRT and close to the Singapore downtown and china town area. Staff was friendly too. Shower pressure was adequate and the air con worked brilliantly.","March 13, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1322,"My wife and I stayed for a couple of nights before taking a cruise, having found a good offer online. The hotel was very clean and modern, on the edge of Chinatown, next to one of the main Police Stations, so felt very safe.Good breakfast buffet, covering not just Western staples, but South East Asian Fare too, which allowed us to try something new and tasty.Hotel above a subway station, 40 minutes direct from Changi Airport. Did not try hotel restaurant, crazy to do that with the fantastic food courts only a few hundred meters away in Chinatown. Good swimming pool, with plenty of space to relax in the shade. If you have been to Singapore you will know why you need shade!Not top price, because not in central area, but worth every penny.","March 10, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

The bathroom on the other hand was big , no bath but a lovely shower.I was having difficulty finding a few cigars, and asking st the desk the staff went the extra mile and found me an excellent store, Old Cuba, within easy walking distance. The store was hard to find and I would not have succeeded without their sterling work.

Firstly we were all given an upgrade to a loft room which was very nice. The beds are so comfortable. 2 considerations for the bedrooms, there is no plug anywhere near a mirror if you need to use the hairdryer or a plug to charge your phone up near the bed where you can reach your phone. Other than that it was a very nice hotel. Clean, friendly, right next to Outram MRT. We were there during Chinese Lunar New Year and it was crazy busy in Chinatown.

1329,"Visting Singapore fro the first time as a family we wanted a hotel to have a good location and this is the best thing about this hotel. It's next to the subway station, one stop from the Sentosa station and 3-4 to Marina bay so from this point of view is great! But there are are many things that are not as great. Firstly the rooms quality, The first room was given to us was in a floor that smelled paint thinner and the room was really terrible with wallpaper teared apart in many places and very dirty carpet, After I went back to the reception to complain they changed the room to a better one but nothing special, just better condition. Another weird thing is that after 8pm if you need a coffee or anything to eat you can't! I never met this in this kind of hotel level before. And the nearest coffee shop or 7/11 is in Chinatown!The situation is being saved a bit by the Korean hotel manager that she is really nice and kind and she will try her best to help as much as she can. But the hotel needs a refreshment for sure!","February 7, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1330,"Just completed a 6 night stay.This hotel is convenient for Chinatown, and very close to Outram Park MRT station. That’s about all the good I can say about it.Restaurant food is not very good at all. The one evening meal I ate their was served very, very quickly. Far too fast for it to have been freshly prepared. It was bland and uninteresting (guests from UK, think cheap and bad chinese takeaway quality). The restaurant plays terrible covers of international pop music on repeat. After one night, I switched to Deliveroo or GrabFood deliveries when eating in.Breakfast is standard buffet food. No yoghurt (if that’s your thing).The hotel bar shuts at about 9:30, and room service stops about 10. Don’t expect service after a long day in the office or sightseeing. After that time your options are a vending machine.There is a an outside pool good for a swim, but don’t expect to sit their to relax with a nice view - it overlooks a building site. There is a gym, but the equipment is tired and in need of repair in places. There isn’t much equipment: 1 bench, dumbbells up to 10kg, two bikes, two treadmills, a cross trainer and a pulley frame. There is bland ‘lift music’ piped into the gym - bring your own music if you want any motivation!The rooms themselves are fine, though quite small by Singapore standards and have quite noisy aircon.I think there is much better for a very similar price, and won’t stay there again.","January 29, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1331,"It was our 4th time with this hotel. We always love the hotel for its location. But the hotel is getting worse by each year we came back to visit Spore. Rooms were so dated. The worse thing was, the room was so freaking dusty! Till i have to do my own house keeping. I was told they had their management changed. Saving cost i assume? Hey, your price ain't cheap for a small room with a 4 star rating. And you made the house keeping people for each of them work for 30 over rooms!! Insane! I Don know how true this could be, but i rather trust my own experience. The proof of a very obvious dust on the radio. It was near to my bed for haven sake! I'm breathing in dust during my sleep. I had nose allergies and when i got home, i was down with a flu! Worst still! You even provided me with a very old torned bath towel!!!!! Goodness gracious. I wonder what is your hotel's standard! Speechless. The structure of the rooms were ridiculous. Water was flowing out from the shower door till i need to ask for extra floor mats! Water pressure was slow. Hot water was inconsistent. One minute i was bathing in warm the next i was shivering. Oh dear. We were happy on our last two trips. Wasn't happy on our 3rd visit and we thought to give another chance. So this 4th will be the last.So good luck! If you can't stand dust, drop this hotel. You will suffer your whole trip. Fyi i did not make a fuss at the reception because they aren't at fault. Because if complaints aren't taken seriously, come on.. why need your customer's feedback?","January 25, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1332,"For a 10 day trip we were looking for a place that would have been central in location, unobtrusive yet warm and friendly in service, have most amenities of a five star hotel and we found all this and more at the Dorsett Singapore. The whole experience from the booking stage where Rose from reservations and Peter Chua the Rooms division manager ensured the initial part was smooth giving the right advise. We arrived on an early flight and at arrival Oonah was a pleasure to talk to, she organised an early checkin which was such a blessing as we had hardly any sleep on the flight and escorted us to our room making sure everything was explained as well as offering any assistance to ensure we settled in well on the first day as well as ensured we had the right amount of amenities inpmmediately. The housekeeping staff who cleaned our room 1013 daily during our stay organised our room the way we had liked it to be, making our daily return to the room feel like entering home. The pool was a great place to relax a fantastic size. All in all a very memorable experience and we surely had some great memories to take back from this trip which was made possible by the all the staff at Dorsett. After being the service industry for more than 25years myself I could help but notice the genuineness of service all across the board from the porter, all the team at the reception, the restaurant staff, the cleaning staff and “Luke”. I’d recommend Dorsett to anyone wanting to stay in Singapore and would surely come back.","January 20, 2019","24    Dorsett Singapore

1336,"We stayed here for three nights at the start of our holiday to Asia. It was the perfect place to acclimatise and adjust to the time difference. The hotel was around $24 dollars from the airport and took about 20 minutes. Check in process took less than 5 minutes. The desk staff were friendly, welcoming, professional and efficient. Our deluxe room on the 8th floor was spacious, clean, comfortable and well equipped with robes, slippers, kettle, water, tea and coffee, lots of toiletries (including razor, toothbrushes, cotton wool etc.) The shower was hot and powerful. TV had a good mix of channels. The in-room safe was nice and big. Big enough to hold a large laptop and several other valuable devices. Air conditioning was functional and quiet. Black out curtains were fab. WiFi was great and free of charge. I emailed reception to ask if they would mind printing out our boarding passes for our flight to Thailand. Within an hour, the boarding passes were printed out and posted under our door. May, the director of rooms organised this for us and was so very helpful and accommodating. She even recognised my name at check out and remember our email correspondence and introduced herself. A lovely personal touch in a busy hotel. Check out took less than 5 minutes a 9:45 am. The door staff organised us a taxi instantly. The location was an approximate 5 minute walk from Smith Street in Chinatown (one of the main entrances into Chinatown). We went each night for tea and a foot massage.  There is a hotel lift for direct access to the MRT station (underground train). A one way ticket didn’t cost us more than $1.70 at any time. Little India was 4 stops away, Clarke Quay 1 stop away and Orchard Road about 4 stops with one change. The MRT is really easy to use. This hotel was the perfect place for us to stay. We slept so well in the King Size super comfy bed and the room was really silent. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to any type of traveller. Will definitely stay again.

Right in the corner of busy Chinatown (Singapore) its a great retreat for some peace and quiet while still within walking distance to a wide variety of food - and being truly spoil for choice! And within walking distance to explore neighbourhoods like Tanjong Pagar, Chinatown and Tiong Bahru And more food. The room was lovely and the shower area relaxing. The pool was good for soaking in the sun and long enough for a few decent laps. My only issue was allthe edges and corners in the pool - not fully safefor children.

1338,"There are two styles of room (two-story loft and one-story standard room) that could accommodate 3 people. I stayed in a loft room that was quite cramped and had the main bed upstairs (the stairs lead directly to the bed platform, so there is nothing upstairs other than the bed). I personally slept on the pull out couch. With the couch pulled out on the bottom level, the room became very difficult to navigate.We had to awkwardly scoot to get to anywhere on the bottom floor. In fact, you could not get into the bathroom without walking over the bed and stepping down into it. We found that one of the closet panels went through to the bathroom so we actually ended up ducking through the closet to get into the bathroom while the couch was pulled out. This was very awkward and uncomfortable. The bathroom sink had no counter space. This was very frustrating as somebody who uses contacts. Just generally, if you are used to placing things down near the sink, this lack of space will be pretty annoying. Also, the placement of the toilet paper is almost behind you when sitting on the toilet, so trying to reach it was awkward. I would frequently knock the toilet paper down when trying to grab some because of how it was placed. However, our experience at the hotel was mostly positive. We had some mixups where the cleaning staff didn't come even when we specifically asked them to. Also, their shampoo/conditioner and body gel bottles were visually similar, so sometimes the cleaning person would give us all of one and none of the other. This just meant we had to call house cleaning to bring us some shampoo. Not terrible, but a weird thing to miss. This all being said, the hotel was very clean and the staff were all friendly. Perhaps if 2 people were assigned to this room (as opposed to three), many of the cramped feelings would be alleviated. The location was only a few minutes walk from Chinatown and using the Grab app made navigating to other places easy. The interior decor is also quite clean in the lobby, and rooms are nice looking (even if not the most practical). The ""rooftop garden"" is some turf and trees and I wouldn't even say it's worth going up there to check it out. However, the pool area is very pretty and serves the same purpose. The gym is decent with a few machines and some weights which is perfectly fine for a quick workout.Lastly, the breakfast food was just okay. I ate breakfast at this hotel twice and they have some pretty standard options. Dinner one night was okay as well. Perfectly acceptable, but nothing special.In conclusion, if you're looking for a nice and clean hotel that's near Chinatown, this is a nice option. I would recommend it if you are not planning on spending too much time in your hotel room. I would always choose a clean but poorly laid out room over a dirty large room. If you're okay with looking past the bathroom sink/toilet paper layout, the shower was very nice with great water pressure. Overall, it was an otherwise great hotel with some frustrating issues.","December 25, 2018","24    Dorsett Singapore

1345,"I booked the room through Booking.com (18 November 2018) for my wife and daughter for their vacation in Singapore. The next day after I made the booking, I was contacted by one of the hotel staff (Nur Sakeenah) that they could not charge my credit card. They sent me a form to fill up my credit card details to be returned back to them. I did and also send the front copy of my credit card. They then proceeded to charge my card for the total amount (S$188.32) of the room and I received a confirmation from them and from my bank (that my card has been charged). On the day of arrival (23 November 2018), the hotel front desk personnel asked for my wife's credit card and proceeded to charge it again for the room charges. She confronted them and said the payment for the room has been made, but they said she was supposed to produce the credit card that was used in the payment of the room. This is ridiculous. Is my wife supposed to carry my personal credit card with her on her trip only to be shown to the front desk ?!!!! Next, my wife asked what happened to the amount that I have been charged earlier. Initially they told my wife, the room rate that I have paid will be refunded in cash. Then later, they said it will be refunded back to my credit card within 30 days! Why was my credit card charged for the amount when all the hotel could do is to withhold the room charges as the guarantee that the room will be purchased? In other words, the room rate had to be paid twice, and one of the amounts will only be refunded back within 30 days. How ridiculous!","November 24, 2018","24    Dorsett Singapore

Lots of problems because they apparently can’t charge your credit card directly, so I might as well have booked it directly at Dorsetts own website, especially when the final price after fees and taxes ends up being the same. Good location for business and sightseeing. Room a little oldish looking, not bad but could need a facelift. It’s a feeling that it once was very push when carpet tapestry etc was new. They have a grand piano in the lobby that plays it self from a USB key. The strange thing is that it would have been so easy to make it cozy, just download a playlist that would have done the job, and people could get sit and enjoy a song while waiting in the lobby. Instead some programmers child had recorded some random notes that kept playing in an endless loop and it played the same 9 notes when we came back for dinner. I asked if I could play a tune. The answer was surprisingly NO, it’s only for display they said. As a pro professional pianist that kind of felt very disrespectful to both a person offering to play a song and to the piano as well.

The bar closed at 10:30PM which was too early for us however Clarke’s Quay is only a 20-25 minute walk by the river front or a 10 minute taxi journey, this place is filled with bars and clubs, strongly recommend if you’re travelling as a couple/friends. Take your room’s travel buddy with you everywhere, this device was a life saver for us!Breakfast was delicious, they offer a massive variety of food both western and Asian cuisines. The pancakes with chocolate and maple syrup were thee best.

The only issue we had was that for the first 3 nights we got charged full price for our drinks at the bar, on the last night we were told that as guests we should receive a 20% discount, we fed this back to reception and spoke with the general manager who apologised for the inconvenience and invited us for a round on the house. All of the staff in the hotel were extremely polite and very helpful. They went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was unique and up to their high standard. When we return to Singapore we will definitely be coming back to the Grand Copthorne!","July 11, 2019","25    Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel

1352,"I stayed for 7 nights in a club deluxe room (room 2604). This is my 4th stay at Grand Copthorne and I love it more each time. Pro's: -easy check in and check out -very spacious room -great view of the city, river and Marina Bay- Privileges of club room include free soft drinks from the minibar, 2 free bottles of water daily, 2 complimentary items of laundry daily. -Access to executive club lounge on 29th floor, including daily breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails (the Singapore Sling was my personal favouirte). Staff here were so helpful and couldn't do enough for you, they didn't even mind when some people turned up 2 minutes before the end of afternoon tea they still served them. Nash, Yingwei, Yani, Owen and Shirley are just the names i can remember but all the staff were amazing. I loved how Nash remembered my breakfast order. Yingwei was also very friendly, I really enjoyed chatting to her. -The room was cleaned to a very high standard. -Location is good, plenty of taxis available outside and if it's early morning the staff will call a taxi for you if there's none available. Buses stop outside and opposite the Holiday Inn (across the road), MRT station is a 15 minute walk away, it's a bit of a trek in the heat but the buses go to certain MRT stations as well. The concierge recommended I buy an ez link card to use on public transport, this was a great buy!-The king size bed was very comfy. -Pool was nice, refreshing on a hot day, not busy either considering the amount of people staying at the hotel. -Staff were really honest with me when i wanted to exchange money, telling me i would get a better rate if i went elsewhere.-Robertson Quay restaurants 5 minute walk away. Cons: -The walls in my room had lots of dirty marks on, they could do with a paint. -One of the dressing gowns had hair on from a previous person, this hadn't been cleaned. I'm sure staff would've sorted this out if I had complained but I didn't feel the need since there was another clean dressing gown. -The aircon was really confusing to work - this could do with being updated. -Jacuzzi is quite cold and doesn't bubble that much - this was disappointing. Overall I had a fantastic stay, this is my go to hotel in Sinagpore, I can't recommend enough. Will defintley be returning in the future.","July 10, 2019","25    Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel

1353,"We stayed here from 24-27 June 2019. We had asked for a room for three adults as we didn't want our 25 year old sleeping on a camp bed. We were advised that we had booked a 'triple room' which 'contain double beds and accommodates 3-4 adults respectively.When we were shown to our room there were twin beds, with a camp bed. When we advised that this was not what we booked, we had to wait three hours and were then shown to a kingsize double, with another camp bed, and advised that this is their triple/quad room. The room was clearly not set up for more than two people as there were only towels and toiletries for two and the only place for the camp bed was alongside of the sofa squashed inbetween the sofa and the drawers and TV!The location is not very central with the nearest underground station to get anywhere a good 15 minutes walk away.

1359,"We had a nice stay in the hotel, the rooms are big and it has a good location for a walk along the canal. But its not 5 Star more of a tired 4 star business persons hotel. Although we upgraded to club lounge we ended up in the ground floor breakfast room as the club level breakfast wasn't the best. The breakfast room directly off reception is a bit strange and its so busy, it was more of a cafe than a restaurant. It immediately makes the customer experience of entering a 5 star hotel less appealing.This hotel was the middle hotel of three 5 star hotels on our vacation and by far the least deserving of 5 star standard. Don't bother with club level if you intend to be out all day. Only benefit is the 2 hour drinks from 6pm. It's an ok hotel but when you have 5 stars you expect the best and its not the best.

1362,"Checked in with another family smoothly at 2am due to a delayed flight , went down for breakfast the next day at 10:15am with my two young kids , 10:31am the breakfast had been taken away without anyone coming to our table informing us of the same, 10:55am a grumpy old Indian waitress asked us to leave the table since it was cleaning time?? Really??? I have never encountered such nonsense before in my life especially since we were still feeding our 2yr old daughter breakfast ! They started mopping the floor below us while we sat there and gave our jet lagged kids their breakfast! We asked for a glass of water for the kids and they refused! Ridiculous Checked out after 4 nights and asked for a late check out by 4pm since I was taking a 7pm flight out of Singapore and my 2 yr old daughter had fever and I wanted her to rest before we left at 4pm. They refused and allowed a checkout only till 1pm. Checked out by 12pm in disgust and checked into the intercontinental hotel for 4hours, they even gave us a free ride to the airport since they figured our child was sick. Avoid this hotel at all costs if you are traveling with family ! what’s the point of calling them a 5star when they do not know how to cater to families with kids, the club room was nice but what’s the pointPay little more and go stay at the intercontinental !

Luggage whisked away and taken to our room, whilst we checked in. Staff were wonderful so friendly and helpful. Room Very large and very luxuriously all the mod cons.

The back of the hotel backs right onto the river so we were able to sit out with a drink watching the little boats go by. walk to the first bridge cross it and there is an abundance of cafes bars and restaurants (Singapore is expensive mind) Just round the corner is the Hop on hop off bus stop, tickets bookable in the hotel.

1366,"Stayed in this hotel for a week, and was impressed with the hotel.The staff were amazing, and the service from them was the best I have had in any hotel. Everyone from the concierge through to reception and restaurant staff went out of their way to help.The restaurant was a decent size, and over the course of 8 days I never had a problem finding a seat for breakfast at around 830am each day. I paid to have breakfast included each day, but I did go across the river to a great coffee shop for breakfast one 1 of these days (head over to Botany, amazing breakfasts, and is only around 3 minutes walk).The swimming pool was a little small, but on the 3 days I used it, it was never busy, so a small-ish pool was never a problem,The downside to this hotel though is that it is 0.9 miles from the nearest metro station, and in the Singapore heat, this is an uncomfortable walk. That being said, there is always a regular stream of taxis outside the hotel.The rooms are getting a little tired now, and are beginning to show their age. I used 2 rooms during my stay (1415 & 1301) and both were tired and in need of refurbishment. The rooms were always clean, but just quite tired.Overall, this is a great hotel, with clean rooms and friendly staff, I will stay here again during my next visit to Singapore, and I can recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city.","June 24, 2019","25    Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel

I had a fall in the street and the care by Shirley, Ying Wei and the duty Manager Mark Yu was fantastic The hotel is situated at the top end of the river, slightly out of the main tourist area but you soon realise that the bars and restaurants this end are the area around Tiong Bahru, a very short walk away is fabulous.

Stayed in an AirBNB which was a disaster 2 years ago and found they are not for me. Might as well have been at home as had to clean it , buy toilet paper ect & put up with things not working in the apartment. The grove is amazing and cheaper. It’s serviced everyday, free wifi, Fox movies for the kids, 4 tvs in each 2 bedroom apartment & 2 in one bedrooms. Great continental breaky included on weekdays only with lots of choice. Bring the vegimite thou.Free shuttle into town hourly to orchid road but also only a $7 cab fare or 15 minute walk .The pool is fabulous with a spa attached , sun chairs & shaded areas. Very quite considering it’s school hols which is nice.tennis court and gym add to this property . My kids are 14.14 ,15,17 so they love the room in this apartment .

The apartment is very clean and tidy. The interior is of high quality and the lighting is very comfortable. The kitchen is well-equiped. The swimming pool is very nice, the staff is friendly. Continental breakfast only on weekdays, it is basic but nice. 2 remarks: the reception did not inform us (and any other guests) about a public holiday when we were staying there so we found the dining area closed for breakfast. There is a shuttlebus bringing you too some places in the city however the bus only runs 1x per hour.

Fast free wifi and handphone which allows you international calls to certain countries.The integrated washer and dryer was so useful as we were travelling but be warned - it takes absolutely hours and so does the dryer which isn't very effectual. It would have been nice to have some coffee and tea sachets in the cupboard as most serviced apartments do - we wrongly assumed we would have basic having flown in quite late at night.Lovely pool and possibly a small jacuzzi (though never figured out how it worked).

1415,Booked a 2 bedroom super deluxe room and got two interconnecting studio rooms - not the family apartment we booked. Staffs response - although we paid $50 per day for the upgrade was that “the photo of the two bedroom on their website is not actually the two bedroom”. The room we booked had a dinner table big enough to seat us all. Instead now we have two tables with two chairs in seperate rooms - and no lounge area for the family to spend time together. But hey - we can sit at two different tables in two different rooms and eat dinner apart. Furthermore told us they are booked out so have to keep what we’ve got but they will check to see if we can upgrade tomorrow! Gasp. Also supposed to be a welcome pack with tea coffee etc. no such welcome back made it to our connecting studio rooms. Not a good start to our stay here. Rooms are clean and tidy but wishing we’d booked somewhere else now - and we paid upfront two weeks before we got hereOnly giving three stars because the place is actually nice - although I feel totally ripped.,"March 12, 2019","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

Everything was included, a stove, fridge & microwave, along with cutlery & crockery.Room can be cleaned everyday if we wished. House keeping & front desk staff are great. Very comfortable whether you're staying with a family or alone. The bus shuttle is available 7 days to give lifts to nearby shopping. The apartments are central to everything, Wifi is very good. The only thing is continental breakfast is till 9.30am, Mon-Fri . I think if the breakfast availability could be extended to the weekend, that would make the stay even more appealing. Thankyou Le Grove for a very pleasant stay.","August 14, 2018","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

1430,"this was perfect for our family of four. (kids ages 9 and 14) We have 5 nights in Singapore and the apartments were large so plenty of space to relax. Two large bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a big lounge and kitchen. All in good condition and clean. Our apartment was higher up and had a good view - I asked for both of these requirements. The pool was great. We didn't have the breakfast as we are all Gluten free and our time zone was so out we were not awake in time most days! The walk down to Orchard road is easy but equally you could order a taxi or use the hotel shuttle. After a big days walking around Singapore the walk home was a bit hard/hot some days but perfectly manageable. I recommend getting the Singapore Tourist pass so you can use the MRT and buses freely. Staff on the front desk were very helpful and accommodating.","February 19, 2017","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

1431,"We stayed for 3 nights on our way to Japan. The apartment was plenty roomy enough with comfortable beds and furniture.The walk to Orchard Rd/shops was fine, we have a 4 & 6 yr old and they didn't mind the easy walk, and if you could time the shuttle bus in you could get a way with walking one way. It is also within walking distance to the Botanical Gardens which the kids managed easily as well.No breakfast on weekends is a pain, as it requires either stocking up on groceries or going out. The room was stocked with 2 coffee and 2 tea sachets, and when I asked for more I was told that they don't supply any more. I found this very disappointing as I couldn't have a coffee while my kids slept on the weekends.There is a cafe in the building next door that was doing a buffet breakfast for $12SD but I didn't try it. Also, they had a coffee vending machine there but it was out of cups!There was some work going on at the apartments on the last day causing a bit of noise, I think they were getting ready to do some bigger renovations.","January 5, 2017","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

It has most of the facilities a hotel would offer, except room service or restaurant, but has the feel of a home. The bedrooms are adequate size and the there is housekeeping service everyday except Sunday. The property is very well located and you can call for taxis by house phone at the desk at anytime. The breakfast ( included, six days/week) is light and sufficient.i have been staying here every time I visit Singapore with family for the last 15 years.The staff are very helpful. I have recommended Le Grove to many friends and to date everyone has been positive in their feedback to me.Two suggestions:1. Arrange coffee/drinks/snacks vending machine in the seating area.  2. Include breakfast on Sundays too.","December 20, 2016","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

1433,"We booked this apartment and paid almost £200 a night for a two bedroom apartment thinking it,s nearby Orchard Road, yes it is as stated on the website, however Km shown on the website are to the end of orchard road.Rooms were not as big as we expected and breakfast? It's probably the worst breakfast I ever had in a hotel or apartment. It includes some water melon, pine apple, oranges, orange juice ( not fresh ) cereals , only one type of bread, butter, tea and coffee. Do NOT ASK FOR FRIED EGG OR OMELATE because they do not provide that.We were 4 in total ( Two disabled on wheel chair ) we took one wheel chair with us thinking hotel might have a wheel chair. Hotel did have only one wheel chair and told us, when ever we need, we will get it back from our room, so kindly don't take it outside. In the end we hired one from the local shop.Coming back to the breakfast, because we had two disable ladies and one career, I was the only one who could have breakfast in the restaurant so I requested if I could have disabled and career breakfast in the room. Answer was, NoI asked if I could take breakfast in the room myself, Elsie said, yes so I asked for a tray, answer was, No We don't have any tray although I could see all trays in kitchen myself.There were very small serving plates so I just took some fruit ( Mainly water Mellon ) in two plates and asked my carer to take some savouries in two plates, no bread, cereals, tea or cofee.Following day when when I came downstairs to have breakfast, I was stoped by Elsie and she told me, I took too much yesterday therefore am not allowed to take that much.That was really embarrassing for me some one accusing me over food. It wasn't too much, water Mellon takes lot of space on a very small plate and I could fit only 5 pcs of water Mellon in a plate, that was disgusting of her saying some thing like that and I felt really embarrassed. What the hell was she thinking, we were greedy over food? If we could afford nearly £800 to book a apartment, we could afford having decent breakfast some where else rather than a labeled breakfast le grove provide.We were there for 4 days, we didn't bother having breakfast for remaining two days.If that is sort of service Le Grove provide, I would rather stay away next time.","November 15, 2016","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

1438,"Decided to stay here than a hotel as it provided better space on this family visit. Certainly a two-bedroom in a good hotel would have seen at least 30% more expensive. They make up for a poor website with an efficient booking system.Check-in was efficient and the room quite spacious. All went well except our disappointment with a not so effective dryer and a front office that lacked creativity and took time to realise they could dry out clothes in another room. The washer dryer was of a really old design for an apartment in this area.Apartment far from MRT but they have an hourly shuttle service during the day but not always convenient for coming back.Do not expect much if the breakfast, it's a basic continental one with lots if pastries.Despite the one mishap, I still would consider staying here again, but more than likely would opt for an apartment much closer to an MRT.

Not very far from the airport (30 min drive). 10 min walk from the Orchard road (Prime shopping place). Don't expect too much from the breakfast (Just english breakfast,, only bakery items, fruit and tea coffee). Only one drawback was replenishment in the room for tea coffee was poor, I understand you have to ask for it, nothing comes by its own like in a hotel.

The location is fantastic. With apartment selling prices being very expensive in this area, having the experience of a one week stay in your own orchard apartment is surreal. We shop for groceries, we cook, all that things singaporean residents normally do and we love it! The size of the living room is huge, the bedrooms are of generous sizes, and although this is a dated property you can still see the luxury touches. There is the shuttle that will take you to a few central locations for free, and if you are an active person (I am not) you will enjoy the walks under big trees to orchard.

1453,"After researching accommodation in Singapore, we decided on this one mainly because of the price and location. Hotels in Singapore are so expensive, so this one was a nice surprise given that it was in the Orchard Road district which we wanted, but wasn't as expensive because it was a 10 minute walk from the main road. We didn't find this a problem though because there was a free shuttle that stopped at numerous places. And with a young family, this was exactly what we needed. Then shuttle service does end early though (about 7pm) but this was a sacrifice we were willing to take considering how much cheaper this place was. The interior is fine, wooden floors, air conditioning, kitchen, laundry. The floor space is more than ample. We had a 2 bedroom apartment. The only thing I could say is the ensuite bathroom's shower was not hot enough, didn't have enough water pressure and the bath you had to stand in for showering was narrow so it wasn't great. We ended up using the main bathroom. There's free included breakfast which ended quite early at 9.30. It was a little disappointing, selection wise, but it's complimentary, so we were happy with whatever we got. It had pastries, toast, tea, coffee, juices, a few cereals and fruit. The pool was also a nice surprise but sadly we didn't have a lot of free time for the kids to enjoy it. It was a large pool and has a spaIf we go back to Singapore, I wouldn't mind staying here again if we were trying to save some money!","April 24, 2016","26    Le Grove Serviced Apartments

1454,"My Mother, unfortunately, requires a lot of medical proceedures as well as health check-ups and follow-ups. This requires our family to visit Singapore very regularly. Over the years I have stayed in quite a few hotels for the shorter visits. But for the longer ones, it is silly to stay at a hotel. So for the last 2 proceedures, we have been staying at Le Grove. Not only is the location ideal, the fascilities are remarkable too. The staff is helpful and efficient. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.It is located on an off shoot road from one end of Orchard. It is equipped with a pool, a gym and a sauna. The rooms are very spacious with decent sized kitches that are fully equipped, living spaces and rooms. Although they have a very minimalist breakfast spread, it is healthy and efficient, especially if you are on the go and do not have time to use the kitchen in the morning. However they do not serve breakfast during the weekend. There is a phone at the recpetion that helps you call a taxi, even when the reception is closed in the evening. They also provide a shuttle service to and from points all over Orchard Road and others. If you dont want to cook, you can always have food delivered. Le Grove has a reserve of good and typical takeout contact info, but with wifi in each apartment, you can look that up yourself. If you are planning on staying in Singapore for a long time and have medical visits to make, this is the most comfortable and relaxing place you can opt to stay in.

Compact kitchen with an initial supply of tea, coffee etc. Furniture all clean and comfortable. with added bonus of washer/dryer in kitchen making stay very comfortable. Plenty of room throughout so that the 5 of us had space. Great pool never crowded when we were there although I suspect the place was full. Only used the breakfast thing one time due to weekends and public holiday closure adequate and busy but you could do your own in your apartment if you wanted more than a continental type breakfast. Handy to Orchard Rd, we didn't use the shuttle preferring to walk out and then catch a cheap taxi home in the evenings. Free wifi was an added bonus for the necessary email catch up.

The apartment was a decent size, they have about everything for an apartment, except washing machine and rice cooker (rice kinda important for us ;)). It has a queen size bed and a sofa bed.In front of the hotel there’s Starbucks and some restaurants. Across the street there’s a fruit stall that we always bought fruits at reasonable price, a 7-11 store and a convenient store.The nearest MRT station is Bencoolen, about 550 meters and some of the path were not covered.It’s a nice hotel apartment, but actually with the same price we can find other hotel apartment with more amenities and larger size.

The apartment is clean, spacious, and comfortable. Housekeeping was courteous , did a great job and we only had to request housekeeping twice even though they are able to do it daily for our 7 nights stay. Staff at the reception are very friendly. The gentlemen who helped us booked a taxi upon checkout to Sentosa on 2nd April was exceptional but a pity I didn’t had a good look at his name tag. We found it a fairly easy walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and there’s plenty of eateries around. For snacks, I will highly recommend Rochor Original Beancurd on Short St which is literally just opposite the apartment building. Beancurd is the silkiest and best I’ve ever tasted. Love the Yakun Toast at the POMO centre near Kaplan for breakfast. Along the same stretch on Selegie Road you’ll find NTUC Fairpress (mini mart) and Watsons (toiletries/medicinal etc) . If you crave local hawker food , you can walk about 7 mins to Albert Centre Market for really cheap food or head to Bugis Junction for more shopping and eating!","April 20, 2019","27    Citadines Mount Sophia Singapore

The hotel staffs were accommodating and allowed us early check in and late check out. There was daily housekeeping (change of sheets every other day). Breakfast might not be fantastic but it was adequate, and main courses varies everyday. The sofa bed in the room was very comfortable. However, my only complaint is the queen size bed. It was narrow and slightly sink in to the middle. It was very difficult for two persons to sleep in. I ended up sleeping with my daughter on the sofa bed instead.

Free filtered for the guests, no need to buy bottled ones.The room was spacious, 1 big bed & 1 sofa bed. A/C was in good condition. Free internet in the rooms. Cable TV. A functional kitchenette with complete amenities: water boiler, electric stove, microwave, fridge, utensils, plates, glasses, sink, & even soap & sponge for washing the dishes. Also in the room: iron with ironing board, safe, hangers, & other wardrobe stuff.Toilet & bath were a bit small compared to other hotels but I didn't mind. Water pressure & heater were good.

We each had our own kitchen, bathroom and living area.The apartments were clean and tidy. Bedding was good (especially the pillows- I took my own but actually preferred the hotel ones!) Decent air conditioning was appreciated with temperatures around 30 degrees C and very humid outside.We didn't really use the hotel facilities so can't comment but the communal areas we saw were clean and inviting.The location was good. Close to Little India and Rochor stations and many others. We used the MRT a lot, but also used the Grab app for taxis from the hotel at times too. Walking distance to Orchard road too.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful as well.Overall a great place to base yourself for a stay in Singapore. We'd definitely stay again.","September 20, 2018","27    Citadines Mount Sophia Singapore

1531,"- Lacking in suppliesWe booked for 4 people through Expedia, which advertised the 2 bedroom suite as having a Queen Bed and Twin Bed. Instead, there is a queen bed, single bed and sofa bed, and you have to call reception to have the sofa bed set up. Bottles of water are only provided on the day of check-in, and they expect you to refill the bottles from the water cooler near the lifts, which was on the other end of the hotel from our suite, through hot, open hallway areas.Even though the hotel is advertised as having complimentary breakfast/breakfast included, we were told that we were not entitled to complimentary breakfast.Whenever supplies were replenished, they were not sufficient for the number of people. We always had to ask for extra supplies. It was also only upon leaving that we were informed that there was a complimentary coffee machine in the lobby.- Lacking in serviceAfter a certain time, guards from a hired security company, not technically hotel staff, are manning the reception, and they are not very willing to help. After asking for supplies one night, the second time we tried to call reception, they had put hold music in place to avoid answering. We had to personally go downstairs to ask for things. We were told to just raise any queries at reception in the morning - but it's generally after coming back to the hotel at night that you require things. There is also no cleaner available and no access to any cleaning supplies at night apparently, because we came back one day to a dead cockroach in the lounge/dining, and while the guards picked it up, they did not clean the stain it left because 'we are not cleaners'. Pics attached.We only stayed 5 nights but one day there was an electricity shutdown and one day the wi-fi was cut off. - Lacking in cleanlinessHousekeeping is not daily. Aside from the above cockroach incident, we found spiders *twice* in the ensuite bathroom. After getting back to our room one night, we found that apparently the cleaner had left a tile at the base of the bathtub open. Pics attached.- Good Location Next to a small food centre and some dining establishments. Since breakfast was not included for us, at least we could have it just across the road.

Quiet place to stay if your neighbors follow the hostel rules which was of course not followed.5. Should have provided atleast one fridge for guests.

Our cubicle has no AC, just ceiling fan, but the other cubicle has one. Hence, it is cool enough. Shoes are not allowed in the room. The shared washroom is quite neat and very clean. They provide towel as well for 1 singd. For ladies, the shower room at the back give more privacy. One can get drink water at the pantry. The upper deck living room is pretty too. The inn is easly reached from lavender station. ","July 24, 2016","28    Blanc Inn

The air conditioning is good, very clean and lots of facilities such as a safe, water dispenser, free coffee and tea. For people travelling by flight.. forget the body wash, shampoo and toothpaste. They provide it. Friendly staffs, convenient location near to mrt (walking distance) and convenient store. Plus free luggage storage. You can even take a shower after check out when you taking your bags. Would go there again next time in singapore. Cheap, hotel feeling in a hostel, recommend it!!

I am being vegetarian the buffet breakfast did not have much choices to choose from unless I am content with bread toast. No fresh juices or fruits (except watermelon was fresh & other fruits like honeydew , melon etc are frozen). Except the food part i like everything else about this hotel.

Right smack in the middle of Orchard Road, subway at your doorstep, freaking amazing rooftop pool, fantastic staff, great bar (Prive!), restaurants, malls and even the cinema literally steps away. Room was not the biggest but certainly not the smallest - unless of course you are the sort who needs lots of space from your travelling companion. Our room #1622 had a lovely little reading nook by the window, and we spent mornings just laying there drinking coffee and enjoying the views of the concrete jungle. One late night we asked for cutleries and Robot Jeno delivered it!! Couldn't be more cuter! Vending machine sells cup noodles, Panadol and even condoms - perfect for those moments when you need the essentials and can't be bothered to dress up to head downstairs.

It was smooth and front desk were attentive.ROOM - the decor was ok, but smells fresh and well-cleaned. Linens were white and clean. The safe was in perfect condition. The hallways were spotless and smells good too.POOL - was exceptionally amazing. Super clean, attentive staff, nice music, overlooking the Marina Sands Bay. The bathroom was equipped with fancy showers and toiletries. It is super clean too,LOCATION - it was in the heart of Orchard road because the train station is just an elevator away and the mall is literally just below the hotel too. FOOD - the buffet breakfast although not complimentary but it was worth it. It has indonesian, chinese, japanese, englisdh, american and french cuisine. We were just planning to to do it first day but ended up availing all throughout our stay.We will go back to this hotel again!

1611,"I was in Singapore for a weekend break and it was my first stay at Hotel Jen, It will most certainly NOT be the last! - A great experience! The location of the hotel is perfect. If you have not been to Singapore before, you could not pick a better location. The hotel is attached to a mall, which also is attached to the MRT station, so getting around Singapore could not be easier You are smack in the middle of Orchard Street with endless choices of restaurants, bars and some of Singapore’s best shopping. Now let’s talk about the hotel itself; every aspect of it was awesome, quirky, fun and it had all the right service touch points without being overly fussy. The roof top infinity pool is an Oasis in the middle of downtown Singapore. The views of the Singapore skyline are amazing and it is the perfect place to watch the sunset while having a cocktail or two! Breakfast was superb and the variety was outstanding. The hotel has a robot named Jeno who delivers your In-Room Dining – How cool is that!!! – My girlfriend wanted to take him home, but unfortunately, he had to return to work after he politely dropped off our order and asked us if we were enjoying our stay! Overall, a great experience and a very well managed hotel. Every single member of staff we interacted with was extremely friendly and courteous – We will definitely be back!","June 16, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

Towel airing rails instead of hooks would also be good.The breakfast was good, with excellent variety, ranging from the bacon and eggs, to local specialties and continental style cold cuts, which changed daily; as we were there for 5 days, it made a difference not having the same breakfast everyday.Staff were unfailingly friendly, but were not overbearing; great also not having a stuffy hotel.

The rooftop pool is fantastic with 260 degree views over the city. The breakfast was good with a wide variety of food and friendly staff.We were also impressed with the service. My daughter had a huge splinter in her foot and we asked reception if they could give us a needle to dig it out. The duty manager, Sylvester came up to our room with a first aid kit. He suggested we take her to a clinic as the splinter was so deep but we insisted on trying ourselves. Between my husband, Sylvester and myself it took nearly an hr. He was so patient and we finally got all of it out. He then organised for Jeno, the robot to come up to the room with chocolates for both my twins which was very exciting for them. There was even a special typed message for my daughter to help cheer her up. These are the small touches that you remember about a hotel.

1621,"We stayed at the Jen Orchard Gateway for two nights as the final leg of our 2 week holiday. We chose it both on personal recommendation and after checking out the reviews here. It did not disappoint at all. We decided to upgrade to Club on arrival, the cost of which was very reasonable and both the service and breakfasts we enjoyed during our stay in the Club Lounge were faultless. Importantly for us it also had comfortably the largest, cleanest and best disabled toilet that I have ever seen (honestly, it was a thing of wonder!). Yes, it is a big city centre hotel and yes, it is part of a global hospitality chain, but the approach of the guest service team from Reception to Lounge to Bar was a tribute to the management who have contrived to create a lovely, relaxed ambience and ensure that this gleaming 20-storey tower of glass and steel has a soul (as well as the most eyecatching of rooftop pools). Every element of our stay from check in to departure was handled with smiling efficiency and genuine warmth. We ate in the 10th floor restaurant on arrival as it was late and we were tired from our journey, although the very helpful receptionist had suggested we went to the Mall next door for its massive Food Court. The restaurant food was very well cooked international fare, which after 7 days of admittedly lovely Indonesian dishes was just what we needed. The poolside bar with its jawdropping Gotham City views was a great place to enjoy a nightcap and one of our party used the bamboo-enclosed gym and said it too was excellent. The location could not be better for MRT access, and even we confirmed non-shoppers were tempted by the well designed mall beneath the hotel; Uniqlo especially proved a hit. Finally, just the other side of Orchard Rd, directly across from the hotel I would recommend a visit to the oasis of Emerald Hill Rd, colourful and photogenic colonial architecture and a scattering of welcoming bars and cafes. Our favourite escape was to sit at a corner table outside the Alley Bar with a Tiger Beer to watch the world go by. ","May 29, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

They have nice swimming pool and the cute Jeno robot. If that’s not the housekeeping I would have given them at least 4 stars if not 5. However one big letdown is the housekeeping was pretty careless. Once they forgot to give me bottle water, the other day they forgot to give me toiletries (and then they gave me a few pieces more on the next day...), there’s also days that they missed 1-2 towels here and there. I also had one incident that they packed my travel buddy on the bed with dirty bedsheets and sent to laundry... luckily I discovered that before it was too late. I am not sure how they can miss a black 15cm travel buddy on white bedsheets. The service manager was very nice and keep apologising though. I am still debating on whether I should book the hotel for my next travel in a few weeks’ time. ","May 20, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

From the moment we arrived until hours AFTER checkout (yes after checkout, we were told we could make use of ALL facilities until our 11:50pm flight home, including being able to shower before our flight) the staff were welcoming and friendly. The breakfast in the club lounge was fantastic, from pancakes, bacon, eggs (however you wanted them prepared), pastries, cereals, meats, cheeses and Asian dishes, it was plentiful and fresh. The pool was voted coolest pool 2018 and I can see why, infinity edge over looking the magnificent Singapore skyline and Marina Bay Sands. Literally steps away from the MRT, hop on hop off bus stop and connected to Orchard a Central and Orchard Gateway shopping centres. The bed was super comfortable (I’m very fussy), fresh clean rooms, 4 bottles of water daily in the fridge. Would not hesitate booking a Hotel Jen Orchard Gateway again and would recommend to family and friends. The highlight for my daughter was JenO (the hotel’s resident robot) she was absolutely delighted when he came to our room with a surprise after checkin. Thank you for a great stay! The only thing I can criticise is the lack of attention on the lifeguard who was manning the pool on a Friday night. He spent more time playing on his phone than he did watching the pool. I’d say he’d look up from his phone every 5-10 minutes for 5 seconds perhaps before going back to his phone.","May 18, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

The price for value, as Singapore is rather expensive, is exceptionally good and we would most likely come again. Close to the area the are a couple of good food courts, one of which is located in the shopping mall below the hotel at the fifth floor (Food Republic) and the second one on the ground floor of the Takashimaya Shopping Centre in Orchard Road.","May 11, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1631,The pool is the best feature about this hotel and it’s location is also good if you need orchard rs and positioned above the MRT makes it easy to get around However we didn’t love our stay - our I’m needed the beds adjusted so we went out for three hours and were told our suitcases would be in our room and bed done Come back to no suitcases delivered and the beds had not even been corrected - hopeless !The breakfast is expensive for what it is - not great value at all !The rooms are bland and have no personality and I don’t like the staff casual uniform! It’s probably meant to look casual and young or something but it misses the mark - no denim!We wouldn’t stay here again - it was not value for money at all ,"May 6, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1633,"We were recommended this hotel by friends due to the location ( right above an MRT) and it’s pool. It was great!For us the biggest selling point was the location - being above Somerset station. When I say above - the hotel is above a shopping mall which the MRT is located under. So you get your normal lift from your room to reception and then walk round the corner to another set of lifts that take you to the mall or MRT. We found the MRT soo easy to use and purchased a 3 day travel card each which we would recommend. The pool was lovely albeit busy at times. The view of Singapore was magical and the sky at sunset is not one to miss. We only spent one afternoon here as we wanted to see Singapore as much as possible. So my recommendation is to stay here if you have some downtime to actually use the facilities. Otherwise your just paying a premium for a standard hotel. What I mean byThat is the hotel is nice but the rooms are standard rooms and it’s the pool and facilities that make it stand your so you want to make sure they get used ! I did notice the noise from the corridor at times and other rooms with loud tv’s but I guess that can always happen. So pleasant rooms but nothing out of this world ( except view see picture ) We didn’t opt for the breakfast to be included as did seem expensive. Also it’s another opportunity to see more of Singapore which offers great brunch restaurants. Although Singapore is expensive. Where we were having lunch around 11 am we then didn’t eat lunch so it did benefit us. In summary , we’d recommend this hotel on this basis you get some downtime to use the pool, gym or yoga classes as this is what makes it stand out and worth the money. Enjoy !","May 3, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1634,"As loyal Shangri La Golden Circle members we thought we would try this property, perfectly located on Orchard Road - directly above an MRT station!We booked a Club room so we could enjoy daily breakfasts and afternoon drinks.Overall, the room was fine for our needs... top floor with great views down Orchard Road.But the real appeal of this hotel is the fantastic rooftop pool! Plenty of room for both couples and families to spread out, and not nearly as noisy or busy as Marina Bay Sands famous rooftop pool! Plus the easy access to the bar is great too.The one negative point for Management to consider - all of the breakfast food in the buffets, both on the 10th floor restaurant and the Club Room - was always cold. Need to ensure food is hot!","May 2, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1636,I tend to expect great service from Asian hotels. Hotel Jen really exceeded my expectations. The service is so kind and genuine. We felt so comfortable there. After a very long travel day we arrived at the hotel. A general manager was on the sidewalk helping with luggage. I wish I could remember his name. He set the standard for all staff members. One piece of luggage arrive with a broken handle. When the case arrived at our room it had been repaired. Where else would this be done?The location is great. The pool amazing.

1637,"I booked this hotel based on the gorgeous pictures I'd seen of the pool and it was indeed lovely. The rest of the hotel was not for us. The rooms were tiny and very Accor/Novotel budget style, they are going to date pretty quickly, and we didn't feel that they were worth $400 AUD per night which is approx. what we paid for the entry level room with breakfast.Some staff were helpful, the uniforms were very sloppy, red sneakers and jeans, the casual clothes seem to match the overtly casual vibe of the hotel, we'd probably thought this was a good product at around $195...again we realise the great pool adds a lot to the package...but if it's raining, then you are left with a motel room at the end of they day !One final thing, the air conditioning was absolutely ridiculously cold. You had to wear winter clothes to walk down the corridors. A horrible feeling in a lovely tropical climate. To be fair this was also the case with all the shopping centres in Orchard rd. I didn't enjoy having to put a jacket on to go into the shops and then a singlet top outside. What a waste of electricity to make it that cold. It was not pleasantly cooler than outside, it was freezing. We would not stay again based on this visit.","April 27, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1638,"Directly above Somerset train station (no you can't hear the trains) in a fantastic location on Orchard rd. Travelled by myself, room size would have been fine for two people. Very modern and clean room, free ice and snack machines on each floor. Pool was excellent and very clean. Hotel is ontop of shopping center and there are many options to eat drink, catching a lift from shopping center to hotel can be confusing, take note of where you caught lift. Easy to access from Changi airport via SMRT, was my first time on train and it was very easy. Stayed here 4 nights and then went to MBS for 1 night. This hotel is much much better than MBS and the pool is better. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","April 26, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1639,We stayed at the Jen Orchardgateway at the beginning of April for a 4 night stay. This was the first stop for us on our honeymoon. As we arrived we were upgraded to a deluxe room and we paid an additional $70 to take advantage of the hotels club lounge. The deluxe rooms were huge with lots of storage space and very comfortable king size beds. The club lounge allowed us to take a great breakfast in the quieter club lounge on the 19th floor where there was plenty of breakfast options for travelers from all over the world and views over Singapore and Orchard rd. We also enjoyed the 5-7pm drinks and snacks which were included the the package. The hotels swimming pool is a huge selling point with incredible views over the stunning Singapore skyline. Great for chilling out after a busy day of sightseeing and the pool bar cocktails were great too. The hotel is located in the heart of Orchard road and directly above the MRT so the rest of Singapore is within easy reach either by foot or by MRT. The hotel staff were always helpful and polite and the service in the hotel bar was great. The hotel even left us a bottle of wine in the room for a Honeymoon treat!This is a brilliant hotel for both pleasure and business travelers and if we get to visit Singapore again I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel.,"April 22, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

Head to Lucky plaza for better money change rates. Very good food hall and cold storage supermarket at Takashimaya next door or Marketplace at Robinson’s.

1645,"I previously stayed twice at Hotel Jen Tanglin before, and gave that hotel a 4/5. But Hotel Jen Orchardgateway is a clear step-up from Tanglin in every way:- the location is just perfect, right in Somerset above the MRT. Tons of restaurants, bars and others around- the room windows do not have the weird orange tint that the ones in Tanglin have- the pool here is very nice (even though I did not have time to use it alas)- room is great - quiet, plenty of electrical sockets, and the size is above average in Singapore- their bar is nearly empty, which I actually love! Makes it convenient to have quiet drinks with people thereSome negatives:- twice, there was only one concierge there, and it took forever to get to him as there were many people waiting for him. Honestly, there needs to be 2 concierge at all times, especially during the daytime- maybe the reason why the bar is empty is because the drinks menu is rather limited...- at first glance, reception looks more like Holiday Inn Express than a 4-star hotel. But once you get over the decor, it was perfectly serviceable.","April 7, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1646,"Chose this hotel due to it's location and the pool are and we were not disappointed. Perfect location close to the MRT so we could easily get around the city without using taxis. The pool area is just what you need after a long day in SIN, or as a quick refresher before exploring SIN. The only thing I would ""warn"" others about, is the bathroom, it has an open solution with frosted walls between the toilet, the shower and the rest of the room. So if you'd like some privacy when using the bathroom, this is not the place. You sort of step right into the room from the shower, so you should really know the person you're sharing the room with.","April 2, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1650,"I've been travelling to Singapore for work and Hotel Jen is where I stay all the time. This hotel has everything you need for a good trip to Singapore - whether for work or pleasure. It's centrally located amongst Singapore's premier shopping district, has an abundance of transport options with a bus station outside, the underground, and taxis for anything you can't walk to. The breakfast buffet is great, varied, and competes with the likes of that offered by top-end Hiltons in locations like Sydney or Bangkok. Swimming in the rooftop pool amidst the city centre with thousands of lights at nightime, and a direct view to Marina Bay Sands is a great way to finish an evening. If you get to the free Thursday night yoga class, let me know how it is - I've never managed to get there yet as I'm normally at one of the hundreds of bars and restaurants in the local area. What makes Jen special is the team - they're great, welcoming, friendly and accommodating.","March 27, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La

1651,"It's almost a mini marina bay sands hotels as it also has a rooftop pool with views across the city - just not on the same scale!We had four nights here on the way back from a holiday in Langkawi. At first the size of the room was a bit of a shock, considering what we used to in Langkawi but you get what you pay for and in Singapore, you're not in the room much! Also, the bathroom was an open design but enclosed toilet, so if this doesn't appeal, you may opt for a larger, but more expensive room.Having said that, the room was comfortable, clean and well kept. Also very quiet with nice views. We could see the MBS from our room.The hotel location is excellent. Right above a shopping centre and Somerset MRT and on Orchard Road. We never ate at the hotel because there are so many eating options around the hotel. I can highly recommend Din Tai Fung at the Centrepoint Mall, level 2 for an authentic experience that's not expensive, and just across the road from the hotel.Definitely recommended.","March 24, 2019","29    Hotel Jen Orchardgateway Singapore by Shangri-La
